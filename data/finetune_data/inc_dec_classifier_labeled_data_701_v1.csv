307,As we develop a comprehensive national energy policy efficiency and conservation are definitely part of what needs to be a comprehensive plan that also needs to include the development of our own natural resources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,p
309,Our notforprofit independent status precludes me from choosing between fuels,n
310,Considering the nations maximized operational capacity increased reliance on imported oil and strained refining infrastructure any complicating factors in the gasoline distribution chain refining outages or multiple smallmarket fuel formulations can easily impact overall supply and consumer costs,n
313,As our country pursues interim storage solutionsand ultimately a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuelit is critical that we ensure the funds necessary to safely transport and store this material are available,n
314,Our aim is to strengthen energy markets and encourage innovation throughout the electricity sector giving consumers more choice and greater control over their energy decisions while also benefiting the environment,d
315,My testimony aligns with the following points America is facing two national security threats one around climate change and the other around the US nuclear power enterprise,p
317,As you know Mr Chairman there have been many developments in the Nations energy portfolio since FERC issued Order No,n
319,Could you describe the goals of your partnership and also what you hope to learn through these field tests and can you give us a sense of when you think carbon sequestration technology could be sufficiently reliable for deployment and for something we can actually begin to rely upon as we structure legislation that in fact might require the capture and sequestration of carbon,n
321,The depressing part of my introduction is I realize I have been at this for 3 decades as part of the House of Representatives staff during the oil embargoes and after I was with Mr Garvin in 1983 and 1984 in the Energy Department running conservation and renewable programs and have been a consumer advocate for the last 10 years,n
322,Other FreedomCAR challenges include technical market infrastructure and public policy hurdles before fuel cell vehicles are commercially available and DOEs vision of a petroleum free emission free transportation system is a reality,n
323,Coalfired electricity is only cheap if one ignores the health and economic costs,d
324,In this same vein expert witnesses are called before us today to discuss policies to deeply decarbonize our economy and strengthen our infrastructure against threats like climate change,d
326,But on the other hand those that want to have exploration we think that the country and the committee should stand behind those States if the prospects are indeed there,p
327,First the authority Congress set forth for setting efficiency standards the Energy Policy Conservation Act is 40 years old and has not been undated to reflect new technologies and economic realities,n
331,Are these coal refusetoenergy facilities typically located in a smaller community or a larger community,n
334,We are committed to working with Congress to explore ways to maintain or enhance environmental benefits of clean fuels programs while exploring ways to increase the flexibility of the fuels distribution infrastructure and minimize costs,p
335,The USGS has actively participated in two previous Federal reviews of MTBE and other oxygenates in gasoline,n
337,We are still overly dependent on foreign oil from countries that clearly we have seen especially over the last 15 years do not represent our interests and values,p
338,Notably the agencies appearing today along with many others signed an MOU in April seeking to establish a cooperative relationship and expedite authorizations of major infrastructure projects including hydropower facilities,d
339,A leading example is the Energy Star Program which is delivering significant results,n
341,They include the bioremediation of mixed waste at many of the contaminated DOE sites the witchs brew that we have left from the legacy of cold war also the enhanced sequestration of carbon by the terrestrial and marine biosphere in order to reduce the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and also as has already been mentioned the production of clean fuels such as hydrogen through the miracles of biotechnology,d
343,The first one is that world oil demand has grown rapidly in the last several years putting upward pressure on price,p
344,To promote economic growth and strengthen security President Obama has called for an alloftheabove strategy that develops every source of American energy,n
348,Electric reliability and environmental protection are both important to this countrys future,d
349,I think one of the things just to add is our COINF2INF emissions from energy consumption are down 13 percent since 2007 so this is already actually happening,n
351,She thought everybody had asthma because they are all breathing that diesel smoke and toxic fumes,d
356,Our nations comprehensive energy policy must ensure an affordable reliable supply of energy and nuclear energy provides one of the solutions to several policy challenges that our nation faces,d
358,Soand the other thing I would add is that they are not clean or completely fossilfuel free the way that renewables are,d
359,Even using power from traditional coal plants to charge a plug in hybrid is environmentally superior for CO2 and criteria pollutants to driving a regular Toyota Prius,p
361,As you all know the first export of LNG to scheduled to happen later this month maybe early March at Sabine Pass in Louisiana right next to Texas my own State,p
364,Strong economic growth particularly in China and the United States is fueling a surge in oil demand,p
366,We support requiring all lightduty vehicles starting in 2023 to be designed specifically to run on this fuel on at least a 95 octane rating and potentially higher,n
368,The method can accept a variety of feedstocks including natural gas coal and biomass,n
369,In early June 2008 the MDH received data from concerned citizens that included measurements of elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide in the ambient air in their community,d
370,I dont know that we are going to pick and choose the generation sources or the energy sources that is where the American peoplefor other policymakers,n
371,It is in the national interest and the interest for our economy to get this going and Texans we are understanding of energy issues and the necessity of getting energy to market,n
372,And there have been a few sites like in Monroe Michigan where there is actually an assembly plant for wind energy,d
373,Americas hydrocarbon renaissance has given us the gift of time,p
374,Diesel is the way of the future and I am hopeful that its shortterm benefits will not be overlooked by the Administration or the Congress even as we examine longer term strategies,p
376,We doare very interested as I said in my remarks want to see the full investigation because we want to understand was there something else people were looking at that caused them to make the decisions they made as opposed to making the decisions that almost any of our drilling operations people would have made differently that led to the ultimate loss of the well,n
377,Number 2 you have got to have six greenhouse gases so the lowhanging fruit that can be accomplished by changes that reduce other greenhouse gases like methane or NOx any of those the hydrofluorocarbons et cetera can help get rid of it,d
378,Senator Dorgan you testified that after reviewing several recent studies on the impacts of LNG exports the Bipartisan Policy Center and Energy Board concluded that domestic gas prices are more likely to drive export levels than exports are likely to determine domestic prices,p
380,Intense foreign competition from Stateowned enterprises poses another challenge for US companies particularly in the civil nuclear sector,n
381,Republicans claimed thenjust as they do nowthat the solution was to produce more oil domestically,p
384,However while we look forward to advanced nuclear technology development it is long overdue to solve our Nations nuclear waste disposal challenge,p
385,Four US States Minnesota Montana Idaho and North Dakota account for 75 percent of all the natural gas brought into the United States via pipeline,p
386,Siemens Ford and Volvo have all made engines that reduce particulate emissions by more than 90 percent and nitric oxides similarly remarkably reduced,p
389,I hope in my discussions with you today that that commitment on my part will come through to you in talking a little bit about what I plan to do and how I plan to bring my experience and my expertise that I have gained in the private sector in the nuclear industry over the years into this project to move it forward smartly in the time that I am in this job and that is my commitment to you,d
390,We believe to create a truly competitive vibrant energy industry these constraints should be removed,n
391,3 would additionally allow substitutions of Transportation Control Measures in a SIP without revisiting the SIP approval process or making a new conformity determination provided that the new measures achieve an equal or greater emissions reduction,p
394,That is why Canadas oil sands is nearly as valuable as an example of energy policy done right as it is for the oil itself,p
395,The problem is that if we look ahead and we look at the fact that natural gas is still a fossil fuel comes with CO2 emissions a coaltogas switch will just not be enough to meet our climate goals,d
396,This bill would require the Secretary of Energy to establish a program relating to the physical security and cybersecurity for pipelines and liquefied natural gas facilities,p
398,Texas Pacific and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts the famous KKR purchased Texas Utility Corporation and agreed to terminate 8 of 11 proposed coalfired power plants,d
399,The United States has such incredible energy abundance,n
400,Remove Market Barriers The first problem we need to solve is a procedural barrier that keeps solar energy from accessing the electricity market,d
401,When they heard about President Obamas proposal to put a tax of 10 on a barrel of American crude oil they all said what the heck what is he thinking,n
402,In addition we recently received an early site permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission which certifies that our site in Clinton Illinois where we operate one nuclear reactor meets all necessary criteria for construction of a new nuclear unit,d
403,The fuel diversity should be a cornerstone of our national energy policy as an important hedge against supply disruptions and price volatility,n
404,Lawmakers must examine the welltowheels cost and impact of EVs from power plant energy distribution to battery disposal,n
405,As you will hear today however we believe that elements of the alternative fuels discussion draft as currently constructed will not fully achieve those objectives and may ultimately be counterproductive,p
406,They are the ones who bear the brunt of higher energy prices and supply disruptions,n
407,So can you explain to why you thinkyou know I realize you decrease emissions but I just am not convinced that that particularly will change much the overall lifecycle of carbon emissions with the batterythe development of the batteries and what it costs to do that when you plug it in how the power is generated,d
408,In fact a new EIA Commission Study concludes that oil refiners would have quote no problem quote meeting a requirement to produce 95 RON gasoline beginning in 2022 and assumes that refiners would meet that standard with E10 gasoline,p
409,A key responsibility of this Committee is to develop and ensure implementation of a Strategic Plan for disposition and consolidation of special nuclear material,d
410,Electricity generated from coal is used in all 50 states,p
411,Consumers determine energy consumption every day through their purchasing decisions and the use of the products they buy,n
412,So maybe someday we have this hole underground it can be used for longterm nuclear storage,d
413,I am concerned that you all dont get noticed under the Clean Power Plan for interaction about what is going to happen when the plants close down,p
415,And I know that GE in my district is working on advanced battery manufacturing that will address storage capacity for renewables,d
417,Adoption of existing test procedures developed through the Energy Star program where energy conservation standards are proposed to be set based on Energy Star performance requirements is appropriate,n
419,If thats the case for a State like Illinois if 40 percent of the power that we generate is nuclear what would that do to our national energy policy and the pocketbook issues what would it do to the price for the individual consumers,n
420,Has the RFS reduced the need for foreign oil,n
421,We see this in the programs that have received proposed budget increases like the 29 billion for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy a 40 percent increase,d
422,And does that make other forms of energy work better or does it replace them,n
423,We do send ethanol by barge as well but I think in this particular study what we are looking at is toxicity,n
424,Of course we are always concerned about keeping gasoline as affordable as possible and some critics of oil exports have raised fears of price spikes,p
429,Mr Linn and Mr Duplessis obviously with this being the largest oil spill in the history of our country theres lots of media attention,n
430,The Clean Power Plan I think makes a lot of sense moving forward,d
433,And three accelerate the deployment of clean energy infrastructure,d
435,I think in the latter part of December in the midcontinent area if you went out and tried to buy gas it was very difficult,n
436,So what we say is we support a vigorous RD program both in reactor development and in recycling reprocessing spent fuel,d
437,As the FERC commissioners make clear in their letter a thorough assessment of the impacts of for example the proposed Clean Power Plan requires the ongoing input of diverse perspectives and expertise,n
438,We dont harness the electricity we can from natural gas we dont sell it we dont pull it up we dont benefit the economy from it,p
445,We have frequently analyzed the consequence of lower world oil prices on different regions of the world,n
446,So I am a bit confused because Ms McCabe testified that the EPA found that fuel efficiency technology development was moving faster than they had expected and is being implemented in the early years of the program,p
447,There have been provisions I have disagreed with and think we should revisit like on biomass from forests not counting toward renewable fuel standards seems to be rather absurd,d
449,Well let me just ask you this then are you basing determinations on LNG exports in part on those discussions with the G7 nations,n
450,Why should we wait for a great big energy bill which may or may not come during your lifetime and mine,n
451,One industry study estimates that there will be 600000 career opportunities for women and minorities in energy in the years ahead,n
454,We know that Chinas use of coal and the world has grown from 20 percent to about 30 percent now and it is expected to get to use 40 percent of the worlds coal in the next 15 years or so we know that Chinas emissions have grown by 80 percent since 1990 and they are expected to grow another 65 percent by the year 2020,n
456,What we also do is allow forwhat the legislation does it allow for technology limits 60 percent I think to one technology 90 percent for two and what that is doing there is saying that although wind today is the cheapest form of renewable power generation ultimately because of these cost curves you want to induce more competition and to see oil prices continue to come down,d
457,fuel receipt and the transportation systems to be compatible with the currently NRC licensed storagetransportation systems then they could classify the fuel in those systems as nonstandard causing that fuel to lose its place in the DOEs fuel acceptance queue,n
459,It goes actually to the heart of what I have talked about which is when you look at energy independence and we look at developing as part of a national security strategy and having an energy policy when you look at those refineries and 30 percent being owned by foreign interests when you look at 30 percent of our oil or 27 being imported into the United States if you want to look at it at a freemarket perspective we dont have a free market,p
462,Im frustrated that the Bush administration is decimating important R D programs and not establishing realistic and attainable goals for our energy future,n
463,And I guess it is a fine line between market uncertainty and price gouging in many of our minds because people price gouge because consumers are uncertain and they know gas costs are rising correct,n
464,Diesel trucks are paying 450 a gallon for diesel,n
465,Governor Corzine has made it clear that lowering energy prices is important for our economic Mr Shimkus,n
469,They must strike a demanding balance between first cost cost of operation and technical features to minimize energy consumption,n
470,The other thing we can do is to make sure that any difficulties associated with splashblended ethanol are addressed by allowing us to incorporate ethanol into other ethers for example ETBE,p
471,So this war on coal must stop,p
473,We are the worlds largest economy but if we do some things that are very draconian on our emissions here in the United States and really all it does is cost us jobs I am very skeptical that the rest of the world is going to follow suit,p
474,There is no question that the oxygenate ability of ethanol is a positive,d
475,Under this scenario a state could never achieve attainment status with its own efforts rather the ability of states to reach attainment would depend on the willingness not only of other states but also of nations around the globe to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,n
476,If we really do something about climate change by reducing COINF2INF emissions and reduced demand for oil can that help us restrain the price increases of oil,d
477,We can all agree that we do need some oil and gas development,p
479,Are weas we move forward in supplementing initial fuelsalternative fuels,n
480,Instead what weve learned from a steady stream of press reports and congressional hearings is that bullet EPA in fact concluded that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public welfare and submitted its finding to OMB in December of last year,d
481,Reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is the right move to make but we should focus on that goal and not lose perspective,d
483,Benefiting from the economyofscale by operating and servicing a larger number of nuclear plants within a single organization these companies will be in a position to handle the financial and technological challenges that must be managed in launching the next generation of nuclear plants,d
484,History is on the side of those who want to act on climate change those who believe in the power of American innovation and our ability to successfully meet any challenge and who look to the future rather than the past,d
487,And I see no way that energy costs are going down,n
488,Chairman Shimkus I would like to point out one in particular the suspension of the Nuclear Waste Fund which we argued we needed to do,p
489,Production off Louisianas shore alone contributes an average of 5 billion a year to the Federal Treasury and that was when oil was less than the 68abarrelplus today,p
491,I also urge that any proposal considered by this committee have the best interests of electricity consumers in mind including the promotion of conservation and renewable and innovative energy sources,n
492,So the advantages that you would get from lets say maybe keeping a lid on the Brent price which affects gasoline pricethat advantage still exists and meanwhile the refineries are still operating,p
495,New teams will come with expertise something like auditors with expertise in energy trading something like that and if they wont perform theyll be thrown out,n
496,Mr Caruso your testimony focuses on the supply side of natural gas,n
497,We are currently bound to a petroleum infrastructure and before drivers will purchase a fuel cell vehicle they have to have confidence in a hydrogen refueling infrastructure,p
498,Also consistent with NPC recommendations the program promotes maximum collaboration between the federal government industry and academia and it establishes a program that is an order of magnitude larger than the Department of Energys existing gas supply RD program,p
499,So in a tangible way the natural gas prices do affect our operations because of the energy costs,n
500,So we could take compliance I think from their current permit applications or new permit applications from generating stations and take that data put it into a database and ultimately from that use it to determine a greenhouse gas performance standard for particular plants that were into the interconnect,n
501,Could we talk for just a minute about the energy policy that is being followed by this administration,n
502,It is our ability to capture opportunities in lowcarbon technology reduce dependence on imported foreign oil and catalyze improvements in productivity more broadly,p
503,As states get closer to the implementation date for their fuel programs the greater the temptation to change the date rather than deal with the uncertainty,n
504,And he says he bids on a job and he has to be competitive with his bid and then overnight the price of diesel goes up and sometimes it goes up from when he starts the job several times before he finishes the job and there goes his profit,n
505,You have already got your nose under the tent with the emissions part of the car,n
507,As we know natural gas prices have risen sharply and likely will not drop substantially until more production goes on line in the United States,p
508,In his address to Congress earlier this week President Obama outlined his vision for a clean energy future that will not only help turn around our ailing economy but also drive new investment and job growth for decades to come,d
509,Last year nationwide production and transportation of gas added 62 billion to Federal and State government revenues and it could elevate to 111 billion by 2020,p
510,How many are actively involved in producing ethanol or biodiesel portion of the refineries,n
511,3136 correctly understand the importance of not prematurely reimposing the nuclear waste fee especially given the substantial balance and large investment interest which accrues annually,p
512,I introduced a bill called the Renewable Energy Jobs Act that will provide pilot programs for training individuals for employment in renewable energy and energyefficient industries on site in these companies,d
514,Over the last decade we have emerged as the worlds leading producer of oil and natural gas and at the same time we lead the world in CO2 emission reductions a fact that proves that energy production and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive goals,p
515,I want to ask you Mr Chairman and each of the Commissioners can you for the record as short of a guarantee state that the NRC is doing its absolute best to eliminate any and all known threats to nuclear safety in this Nation,p
516,In some conversations that I have had with individuals concerned about some smaller engines those in boats or motorcycles and other specialty vehicles they have had trouble running on even blends with 10 percent ethanol,p
517,Above all the rhetoric and the different reasons why many of us oppose the Yucca Mountain project this committee and this Congress must ask itself whether the Nuclear Waste Policy Act has been followed as Congress intended,n
518,American innovation and our abundant energy resources can and should be leveraged to protect our allies around the world from unreliable and unfriendly regimes and promote our interests,n
519,Along these same lines the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 could be amended to provide the Commission with the sole authority to establish standards for highlevel radioactive waste disposal,d
520,It would affect ethanol prices to some extent,n
522,Stockpiling should be carefully investigated by EPA and the exact amount of gas should be deducted from the critical use exemption totals each year,n
523,Finally we must determine the most environmentally sound methods of increasing energy supplies for our country,d
524,In 2009 DOE was appropriated about 36 billion under the Recovery Act to increase taxpayer spending on energy efficiency environmental cleanup loan guarantees and various energyrelated research development and deployment projects and activities,n
527,Everybody on this panel supports there being not just on stationary sources but on mobile sources like tailpipe emissions for cars and trucksthe industry and labor union that represents UAW supports a mandatory cap and trade system,n
530,But if only 2 percent of the natural gas escapes through to the atmosphere then we are going to be in worse shape than if we used coal,p
531,The gasoline sulfur standard is a national annual average standard set at 30 parts per million a 90 percent reduction over current national levels,p
532,Were very pleased to be here to discuss the final report of the Commission to Review the Effectiveness of the National Energy Laboratories,n
536,And you indicated up front that innovation and energy was one of your was one of your goals,n
537,The American Gas Association represents 192 local energy utility companies that deliver natural gas to more than 53 million homes businesses and industries throughout the United States,p
538,The result has been policies that deter and forestall increased usage of natural gas which is after all the nations most environmentally benign and costeffective energy source,p
539,For the first time in six decades the United States is a net natural gas exporter,p
541,In addition we need to take into account potential threat to the security of gas deliveries to consumers that will occur if we place a greater demand on our production and pipeline delivery capabilities than we have resources to meet,n
542,When Mr Fawcett and maybe someone else was talking about the oil overseers after the American and Norwegian left and there was only the French and Russian and there was implication there that then they were being selfserving that is incorrect,n
544,Some of these accomplishments include the fact that as you mentioned Johnson Space Center with the help of FEMP technical assistance and through the use of our AFFECT which is Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies program through the use of our Federal Energy Efficiency Fund authority was able to provide 47 million of investment,d
546,This of course means that we will have to have an increase in nuclear waste and we need to safely store it,n
547,Today Big Oil and Big Coal have been working with the Republican thought police to comb through each and every reference to global warming pollution in the Clean Air Act and then disappear them sending scientific consensus down the memory hole at the expense of public health and welfare,d
548,And so figuring out a mechanism to make sure we can do the work necessary to be able to fully use hydropower is critical,d
549,But the idea is to produce or to construct a coal gasification facility that will simultaneously produce electricity and produce hydrogen,p
551,Just as an illustration to make it as clear as I can with a chart that looks fairly complex I will try to simplify it at just how dramatic the changes are that I refer to in thein what is happening today in clean energy,n
552,The mismanagement for example of nuclear waste clean up processes has been an ongoing Department of Energy problem across several Administrations,p
554,This initiative requires relatively modest federal investment in nuclear energy research and development,d
556,Forcing fuel switching from coal to natural gas is a tool of compliance by contrast maximizes the costs of compliance,p
559,The savings from the CAFE proposal like I mentioned is more than three times proven reserves of oil in the United States,n
560,This is what he said Simply put the Clean Air Act oxygen mandate slows environmental improvement raises costs and is no longer required to ensure substantial and sustained ethanol use in California,p
561,You would be a real hero if you could get us the energy bill,n
562,But domestically it has both led to a tremendous renewal in manufacturing170 billion capital invested in just in the kind of the chemical arena and by the way also reducing carbon emissions,p
563,Renewable fuel standard is putting 36 billion gallons of nongasoline into the gasoline and diesel supply through the next few decades,p
564,You guys are the guys who can make this happen because of your connection with mostlyyou have some friends over on my side but you have a lot of friends on the Democrat side and they are in charge and so I would plead with you and the other folks who are looking for expansion of energy opportunities the operating engineers the electricians that they hold out for a good bill that they are not going to lose their jobs,n
565,Well that was under the greenhouse gas requirement but did anyone at EPA consult with the Office of Management and Budget or the White House before moving forward with taking over the flexible permitting program under the Clean Air Act,n
566,It is time for Congress to provide an updated National Energy policy,n
567,I am here to speak a bit about the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that nine and soon 10 States in the Northeast have embraced to deal with greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity generation sector in our State,n
568,In the next 2 weeks large oil pipeline operators will be in compliance with the required baseline testing deadline of the highest risk segments set by the regulations,p
570,We dont just rely on Idaho National Lab although Idaho National Lab is a flagship lab for nuclear energy we are relying on Oak Ridge we are relying on many of the others and Lawrence Livermore and other labs,d
572,I think its increasingly obvious that the word green here in this case really only means low carbon,d
573,The fossil fuel industry and House Republicans have a credibility problem when it comes to claims about the economic impacts of the Clean Air Act,n
574,We believe that the first of these recommendations P0001 related to the use of E911 when damage to a pipeline results in the release of gas or other hazardous substance has been resolved with a change to the best practices and recommendations to OPS earlier this year,p
575,There has been a lot of investment and that has been a lot of indirect jobs that have gone into that in building renewable refinery capacity and it is all happened not at the expense of the petroleum industry,p
576,The Report notes that The energy burden on lowincome households as a proportion of income is four times greater than for other American households,n
577,And on top of that we reached an agreement last year with the operator of the three largest coalfired electric generating units in New Jersey that are going to bring major major reductions in emissions from those units,p
578,Congressman if you dont mind I think I will jump into this first and I would ask maybe to submit for the record the most recent comprehensive study conducted by the Department of Energys Argonne National Lab which looked at all of the energy balance studies that have been done over the past 10 and 15 years and concluded that without question ethanol has a positive energy balance,p
580,I have introduced legislation with my friend Mr Doyle to make common sense reforms at the NRC to provide existing plants some relief but without a strong domestic industry how do we expect American technology and more importantly safety culture and nonproliferation standards to compete with staterun power companies like Russia and China,d
581,As the DOE continues to delay honoring its contracts with the utilities to remove spent nuclear fuel from plant sites both the amount of SNF and HLRW stored and the costs associated with storing it increase,p
586,But as we look at the list of states with a high percentage of carbonbased fuels we look at Massachusetts at 90 better than 90 percent Michigan 86 percent Texas at 95 percent even Wyoming at 97 percent,p
587,The article went on to note that in just the Bakken and Three Forks plays alone the US Geological Survey estimated that there are 74 billion barrels of recoverable oil and 67 trillion cubic feet of natural gas waiting to be tapped,p
588,And you know if we look at emissions they really have to be looked at on a global scale,n
589,The bill would short circuit the established review process for pending and future LNG export applications,p
591,Technological advancements on the electrical grid from transmission through end use have helped improve efficiency and reduced emissions,n
592,We cut back a lot on the energy efficiency programs because we have done so much so far,n
594,This authority is vested in the Secretary of Energy and has been delegated to the assistant secretary for fossil energy,n
595,My advice to you would be that there would be incentives for the continued investment and development of technology to reduce carbon which does not yet exist,p
596,So to the extent the administration is supportive of incentives to increase these alternatives whether it be geothermal or solar or wind they can provide an extra cushion and certainly with a hydrosystem and wind projects allow us to store power as you know in the water and allow us to shape the power curve,d
598,Again less American jobs more dependence on foreign oil,n
600,In any event I would like to say that I am pleased that our agenda has shifted from a debate over whether to abolish the Department of Energy or to sell off the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to a more prudent and national debate over the national energy policies,n
601,Instead as the threat from climate change becomes more and more dire and the scientific consensus of the threat becomes even clearer we are having another hearing focused on the alleged war on coal,n
603,S 389 extends the existing credit and creates a second drilling window that also applies to heavy oil,p
604,But our bipartisan group has reached out and said you solveyou give us a waiver on ethanol,p
605,Because they will now have the controlling interest in that oil field so they can do what,n
606,And of course it is troubling as a consumer but also I mean I guess because of theof 10 percent ethanol I spend a lot of time at my lawn mower repair shop Lowerys Motors in Lewisville Texas and he said that the ethanol in gasoline had been very good for the lawn mower repair business or the small engine repair business because he gets a lot of business,p
609,This outdated physical integration requirement prevents utility companies from investing capital outside their geographic region shutting off a valuable potential source of domestic capital investment in needed energy facilities and ironically fostering the very kind of concentration in regional energy markets that FERC is trying to reduce,n
610,And I hope that we can find new ways to use coal even cleaner than we are using it today,p
612,I will make a comment from the perspective of energy efficiency,n
613,I was sitting here listening thinking of a hearing we had not many weeks ago and Mr Greenspan was with us talking about the current situation with natural gas supplies and pricing in this country,n
614,Dr Ebinger paints a very positive picture resulting from lifting the crude oil export ban reporting a gain in GDP over the next 25 years of 600 billion orbillion to 18 trillion,p
616,These criteria include balancing reasonable cost burdens encouraging lowcarbon technologies providing a uniform national policy and finding the most costeffective ways to reduce emissions without choosing winners and losers,p
617,This is clear in the repeated attacks on our oil and natural gas industry and its people which has provided tremendous opportunity and driven advances in cleaner energy generation that are benefiting the globe,p
618,Mr Shimkus asked earlier whether climate legislation would raise gasoline and electricity prices,n
619,NNSA is responsible for overseeing the approval while consulting the Office of Nuclear Energy and the DOE general counsel in addition to interagency coordination,n
620,In addition ethanol cannot be carried in the nations pipeline system and must be segregated from the wholesale distribution system until its addition at the truck rack,p
622,But for the sake of our consumers our utility businesses and Americas entrepreneurs and innovators we as a Nation could take a better course of action and enact a national energy policy to begin the transition to a lowcarbon economy,n
623,Do you think that all drinking water systems that are located near wastewater treatment facilities that accept drilling waste should monitor intake water for radioactivity and other potentially hazardous byproducts of these activities,n
624,What do you see as the Federal Governments proper role in encouraging the use of alternative fuels in vehicles,n
626,It is with growing incredulity that the rest of the industrialized world views the effectiveness of energy industry disinformation campaigns with the American public,n
627,We have a very favorable climate for construction approval siting of new power plants new generating facilities,n
628,We have been asking for a number of years for the Department of Energy to do the necessary investigations to start making those kinds of determinations and we dont yet have that information in place,n
630,A big driver for renewable energy development has been the willingness of States to forge ahead despite the absence of federal leadership,d
632,In addition the NRC explained to our committee staff that the operator was able to avert core damage in the full power loss scenario by activating a steampowered reactor cooling system also known as the RCIC but some NRC analysts have questioned the ability of this system to function when battery power is lost,n
635,Sometimes we will give them energy sometimes they will give us energy,n
636,The wood products industry is a leading user of wood fiber and producer and user of carbonneutral renewable biomass energy to run our plants,d
637,Primarily because of the growth in China and India for oil demand we believe oil prices will continue to increase which will place greater pressure on gasoline and diesel prices,p
638,Contamination from industrial facilities pose a more troubling longterm concern with more than 40 oil spills recently reported in Louisiana by the Coast Guard and thousands of chemical containers spotted bubbling in the regions flood water,d
640,The Association of Oil Pipe Lines is a trade association of owners and operators of crude oil and refined petroleum product pipelines,n
641,COMMINGLING OF DIVERGENT COMPLIANT FUELS First Congress should adopt a legislative provision to permit the commingling of divergent compliant fuels,n
642,I think essential to the Yucca Mountain project to store the spent fuel down there would be a rail line,n
643,Heating oil provides heat to only about 7 percent of the fuel consumed by residences on a national basis but the demand is not uniformly distributed the Northeast consumes the about 73 percent of all the heating oil used in the country,n
644,Some Republican Members cannot seem to decide whether they like cheap natural gas or see it as a threat that must be overcome to protect the coal industry,p
645,The way this technology or what enables this is that we took the genes that encode enzymes that would transform the sugar into the fuels,d
646,Recently the Subcommittee received testimony it would take at least seven to nine years to just to begin transporting used fuel regardless when a site is available,n
648,I am pointing out the title of this hearing is legislation to respond to the BP oil spill and yet I dont see anything in this bill that actually helps us address the problems we are dealing with today,n
649,Under the Clear Skies Initiative all Americans will benefit from cleaner air as emissions of the major pollutants from power generation SOINF2INF NOINFXINF and mercury are reduced by roughly 70 percent,d
651,But the problem is that even with this particular issue included with the high gas prices we are not seeing any correspondence between underlying costs and prices in the wholesale market,n
652,The Department of Energy was supposed to select two scientifically appropriate sites one east of Mississippi and one west of Mississippi River,n
654,Boutique fuels only result in supply problems when a refinery problem or pipeline outage occurs,n
655,The environment doesnt benefit and you have these constricted flows and it seems to me it does not benefit anybody other than the industry that is out there designed to shut down any progress on energy development,n
657,We have a distinguished panel that will cover all aspects of the issue from coal production to power generation from labor issues to environmental impacts from clean coal technology to consumer impacts,n
659,Our work on energy issues has described some of the consequences of hurricanes on petroleum marketssuch as rapid gasoline price increases,n
660,That is why he established an interagency working group focused on creating economic opportunities for communities impacted by the shift away from fossil fuels,d
664,Surrounded by 10 feet of polluted oilslick water without power or reliable communications the staff at Memorial worked for nearly five days to treat feed and evacuate patients families and local residents who sheltered in the hospital,d
666,For natural gas the market is strong and active,p
670,At the end of May working gas in storage stood about 38 percent below endofMay 2002 levels and 28 percent below the previous 5year average,d
671,And so I think that to help wean Europe off of Russian energy this might be a good thing,n
672,We have learned that MTBE if leaked or spilled can contaminate water supplies more readily than other components of gasoline,n
673,The number of oil rigs operating in the United States has quadrupled in just the past 3 years,p
674,That being said Dr Friedmann how do you react to the allegations that the administration is waging this war on coal,n
675,As shown in Figure 3 two consequences of this flat production have been significant shortterm increases in natural gas prices reaching to near 1000MBtu combined with a substantial increase in its longterm price trend,d
676,That invisible oil slick is now causing the oceans to become acidic,d
677,Page 11 of your testimony you recommend that Congress require the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee CASAC to comply with the Clean Air Act Section 109d and advise the Administrator of any adverse public health welfare social economic or energy effects which may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of air quality standards,d
680,And Section 401a1 of the Clean Water Act precludes the Commission from licensing a hydroelectric project unless the project has first obtained state water quality certification or a waiver thereof,n
681,By definition costeffective conservation is less costly than any other energy resource and conservation reduces consumers bills,n
682,But certainly it is important right now during this time of needed supply with questionable reliability to have any and all energy,n
683,We have a great record in the Northwest on saving energy through conservation,n
686,For example we believe that production tax credits for renewables should be extended at least ten years and apply to as broad a spectrum of renewables as possible,d
687,It is somewhat more complex and if you are familiar with how DOE is organized Mr Stupak the vast majority of work at the Department of Energy including our nuclear weapons work our research laboratories Mr Stupak,n
688,It has helped integrate renewables online,d
689,Its very simple Because they have no incentive whatsoever to give access to the resources to oil companies,d
690,And we under this plan would not have the flexibility to build a new coal plant if natural gas prices go up because the technology is not available to be able to do it in an economic way that would make it possible to do it,n
691,In San Joaquin Valley the stationary sources which include agriculture oil and gas production your ma and pa operations all the way to your biggest manufacturing they make up only 15 percent of the pollution now because we have imposed the toughest regulations in the nation on them,n
692,Creation of a governmentindustry partnership to pursue two short term objectives resolving technical andor economic issues associated with the new nuclear plant designs and validating the new licensing processverifying that it works as intended and will not place private sector investment at risk,d
693,In any event we recognize that projections of energy markets are highly uncertain and are subject to many random events that cannot be foreseen,n
695,Secondly the other consistent thing in that report as I stated earlier is the natural gas impact is having on the marketplace in general in terms of retiring old inefficient plants,n
696,Our staff closely tracked the markets to make sure that no one took advantage of the situation to manipulate the energy markets,n
697,In our particular area if you think of wind turbines or solar panels or efficient gas turbines those rare Earth minerals are not actually a major component of our decision making in where to locate,n
699,As you are aware ConocoPhillips supports passage of a comprehensive Federal law establishing a clear and transparent price for carbon,p
700,As I say in the blueprint here using energy more efficiently is akin to developing more fuel,n
701,I am pleased to report that last week the House overwhelmingly passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018,d
702,If we ask any energy trader they will tell you that is the first thing that they look at,n
703,Just a few short years ago many would have scoffed at the suggestion that America could produce enough domestic energy to expand its exports or that low natural gas prices would induce a manufacturing renaissance,p
704,First it is the tax subsidies for unconventional energy that by far have the most detrimental effects on markets prices and consumers,n
705,Regarding regional impacts of an RES also raised in many of the opening statements different parts of the country have access to different types of renewable energy with different cost and performance characteristics,n
707,The experts EPA and the National Academy of Sciences have already drawn the conclusion that especially in the short run when we need greenhouse gas reduction the most corn ethanol is increasing emissions by increasing the amount of carbon that is released into the atmosphere,d
709,On the third page of this document listed are two independent spent fuel storage installations,n
710,You can obviously absorb excess spikes in natural gas prices for a while and indeed many have done that over the last number of years,p
711,If we want the industry to be capturing carbon in 2020 shouldnt we be telling them about that now in order to create the market signal,n
712,I am pleased to present the administrations views on the need for comprehensive energy legislation,n
714,Members of my local union located in Michigan spent months working on the TransAlaska pipeline which covers 800 miles and carries oil from the North Slope of Alaska to Valdez Alaska,p
715,We talked about earlier and some of my colleagues talked about the carbon sequestration and how it is notthe technology is not there at this point in time,d
716,There are a lot of options available to us in the short and long term to produce hydrogen from a variety of different sources and thats one of its attractions,d
718,And what we need to do is focus on how can we most efficiently reduce consumption and help reduce those overall energy costs,n
719,For illustrative purposes 43 quads is equivalent tobullet Over 20 million short tons of coal or enough coal to fill a coal train of railroad cars almost 2000 miles longbullet 418 billion cubic feet of natural gasbullet Almost 35 billion gallons of gasoline or more than 10 days of US gasoline consumptionbullet Almost 10 hours of the entire worlds energy use based on consumption levels in 1996bullet Nearly half of the approximate annual primary consumption of any one of the following states Arizona Arkansas Colorado Iowa Kansas Mississippi or Oregon based on consumption levels in 1996 This 43 quads represents a 39 total annual savings in cooling and a 19 savings in heating or a total heat and cooling savings of approximately 25 billion per year by 2010 given an adoption baseline of 1996,n
720,He said in his oil statement and again just now that somehow companyan individual company would have to go out and assess the exposure not only to their use of the chemical but to everybody else on the market,n
721,Again I have those plants I have coal plants but I also have refineries and chemical plants that have another issue,p
722,For instance over the last several years FERC issued two landmark orders facilitating energy storage and aggregated distributor energy resources participation in our organized wholesale markets,n
723,Does anybody believe that the coal industry should have the right to put unlimited amounts of carbon dioxide at zero cost into the atmosphere,n
727,Secretary Moniz I want to talk to you specifically about access and equity in the energy transition,n
728,Through the Recovery Act we are making hundred million dollar grants in grant funds available to help the transit industry to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions for bus rail cars and other transit equipment,n
729,As a result diesel vehicles will achieve gasolinelike emissions levels,p
730,And we also operate the Nations most active LNG important terminal at Cove Point Maryland,p
732,We cannot simply solve this crisis without focusing increasing our energy efficiency,n
733,The company also engages in new hydropower development through the building of new plants at existing dams,d
734,The money basically comes from private investors in Kyoto party nations like in Europe who choose to get some of their emissions credits through the clean development mechanism by investing in countries like China or India or African countries or developing countries around the world,d
735,Offering alternatives that must be included by the Secretary is an unnecessary infringement on the agencys authority and expertise but granting this preferential treatment to hydropower interests is patently unjust unfair and inconsistent with every other element of the Federal Power Act,n
736,Excavation damage is the leading cause of natural gas distribution pipeline incidents,d
737,And at that time and today state regulators agree that users of electricity from nuclear power plants should pay for the Federal nuclear waste management and disposal program,n
739,Well I am just in the research and analysis business but I would thinkand my friends in the industry can speak perhaps better but I think the biggest concern or two really one would be that the government is going to stand in the way of infrastructure projects that are needed to get investment in domestic oil and gas production and the second would be uncertainty about regulation of hydraulic fracturing going forward,d
740,The fact remains it was under Secretary Salazar that BPs initial exploration plan was reviewed and approved by the Minerals Management Service,p
741,And with Canadas vast proven oil reserves the prospect of North American energy independence is no longer political rhetoric but a promising reality,p
744,The President proposed a clean energy standard to increase the amount of energy we get from renewable sources of energy as well as from nuclear and advanced natural gas plants similar to what Mr Barton proposed from the last Congress,n
745,WANO is organized through regional centers and includes every operating nuclear electric plant in the world,n
746,Energy is the issue and it is one we need to deal with thoughtfully carefully deliberately through the legislative process,n
747,Whether surface temperatures will increase due to radiativelyactive emissions is not clear,n
748,I think what the President is most concerned about is that he would like to move the energy agenda forward,n
750,We may even get some pleasant surprises such as we recently experienced with the shale gas revolution,p
752,It is a lesson for all of us as we consider the location of new LNG terminals as we become more dependent on natural gas,p
753,In this case industry recommended that to improve the NSR program we should allow owners of a facility to avoid the requirements of the NSR program if they improve facility energy efficiency or if they invest in a project for pollution prevention or pollution control simply on those bases,n
754,More recently while on the US Air Force Headquarters Staff I participated in developing and managing the response to the real world cyber attacks against the Department of Defense information infrastructure that came to be known as Solar Sunrise and Moonlight Maze,d
756,For example if the fuel efficiency of our personal vehicle fleet was 42 miles per gallon today rather than 21 miles per gallon US oil demand would be lower by 4 million barrels per day oil markets would have spare capacity and the impact of any gasoline price spike would be far smaller,d
758,There are tremendous opportunities for further job growth in the clean energy sector but to harness that potential we need to continue to evaluate and recalibrate Federal policies,d
760,Id like to talk about one thing that largely did work and thats nuclear energy,d
761,Independent producers develop 90 percent of domestic wells and produce 85 percent of domestic natural gas,p
762,In conclusion I would say new nuclear power construction is prohibitively expensive renewable power is variable and not yet scalable and coalfired power plants are under constant attack from the EPA,n
763,My testimony today will provide a brief overview of the hydropower licensing program and some of the challenges it faces,p
765,We have seen cases in Pavilion Wyoming and in Dimock Pennsylvania where the EPA has also accused oil and gas operators of groundwater contamination from fracking without sufficient evidence to justify those accusations,p
768,From a consumers point of view the Nation will be better off if we have a wide range of generation options and let the market work out the most cost effective solution to supplying our energy needs over time,n
769,If you export natural gas you factor into that equation the effect on US consumers and whether it is in the best interest of the United States,n
770,So this slide shows how you would replace one nuclear reactor that is 1154 megawatts with wind,d
773,The changes would inappropriately expand FERCs natural gas authority attempt to undermine States rights and undermine the important role that other Federal and State agencies play in protecting natural resources for the public,d
775,All of the research that we have done points toward the need for a full portfolio generation options which includes the need for all forms of thermal generation including nuclear and coal,n
776,About 20 some percent and yet their carbon footprint is how much more for that production,n
777,As a physician and someone who represents constituents who have experience too many environmental injustices I am committed to working with members of this committee to create a cleaner and healthier environment for all,d
778,And you will catch some really good fish and some of the best eating you are going to find right there next to the oil rig,p
779,One way that I believe the commission can help to ensure reliability is through open communication and a strong working relationship with the EPA the Department of Energy the States and NARUC the North American Electric Reliability Corporation or NERC regional transmission organizations independent system operators and industry,n
780,At the risk of going a little bit off topic for what this panel was asked to talk about which was lowcarbon electricity and carbon capture and storage and renewables I wanted to at least frame the issue as also associated with the renewable fuel standard that was passed by this Congress previously,d
781,Today we are examining a law the Renewable Fuel Standard or RFS that is driving development of those new lowcarbon renewable fuels,d
784,This need not be limited to natural gas or other energy products,n
785,We have partnerships throughout the United States and with universities with national labs with all kinds of differentand other companies as well looking at everything from hydrogen to of course batteries and electrification of the vehicles and what is happening with compact natural gas and everything else,n
786,And either the oil itself or something in it is whats likely causing this outbreak,d
787,As Member of Congress from East Harris County and Houston Texas I have just literally hundreds of people who work offshore offshore Texas offshore literally all over the world and along with our infrastructure we still produce oil and natural gas in a very urbansuburban area but we also have refineries and chemical plants who need that product that is being produced,p
788,We simply cannot support eliminating the RFS program as the draft envisions without a much stronger signal to the market that ethanols role in our fuel supply will continue to grow,n
791,Since the drafts release the Environmental Protection Agency has issued a finding that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare,d
792,Can you elaborate why this makes such a difference for your members in providing greater certainty to prospective purchasers for redevelopment of petroleum contaminated brownfield sites that are cleaned up under a State program,n
794,The technology allows older coal plants to be retrofitted to burn cleaner eliminating the hassle of permitting a new power plant,p
795,Accordingly I request that the Agency work with Congress particularly Chairman Shimkus Mr Welch and me as we try to develop interim and longterm solutions fuel solutions that are good for the environment and good for auto mileage good for the American consumers good for the agricultural and ethanol interest and really good for all impacted stakeholders,d
797,In recent years we have seen the impact of relying almost exclusively on natural gas based plants for new generation tight gas supply higher prices and backlogged projects for natural gas based plants,d
798,While the nodrive program did not produce the desired results the cleaner burning gasoline did,p
799,We will invest in medical research and clean energy technology,d
800,In the first hearing this subcommittee had this Congress my constituent the manager of a local rural electric cooperativethat is a notforprofit entity for those who are in the businessand a former environmental officer at the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency testified that doing so would increase utility rates for again a notforprofit electricity company by 25 percent,n
801,It is the utilities driving renewable growth and many other independent power producers driving renewable growth and we can take advantage of those independent power producers through very competitive RFPs and PPAs and certainly with our own facilities,d
802,But you continue to hide evaporative emissions by even using tailpipe emissions in my opinion,d
803,Towns which adds some common sense to a currently onerous relicensing process for nonfor Federal hydro projects,d
804,For these technologies air pollutant emissions will be associated only with the transport of the hydrogen to the point of use,d
805,Secretary Hogan in 2007 Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act,n
806,But the good news here is that the shortterm energy markets appeared to adjust rather quickly to the collapse of the largest energy trading company in the world,n
807,I mean that is why we want gasoline or diesel or biofuels or something,p
809,And I visited Oregon Techs oneofakind geothermal plant in August and saw firsthand how they are taking advantage of great renewable resources in the Klamath Basin,d
811,Last year the House included a provision in its energy bill requiring a Federal study into this boutique motor fuel issue,n
812,We strongly support the need for a comprehensive energy policy that focuses on adequate supply sources to aid strategic industries such as ours,n
813,Now sir since coming to the EPA I would like to ask you have you met with the American Petroleum Institute,n
814,Unfortunately due to nonmarket governmental forces giving preferential treatment to certain renewables two of these plants Byron and Dresden are now slated for closure,d
815,that material out to do exactly what Canada is doing to do exactly what needs to happen on the FremontWinema National Forests where you have more than 200000 acres of federal forestland that is exactly that way buginfested lodge pole pine when that material comes out why in the Devil do we say it is not renewable and cant be turned into pucks like this to help reduce carbon from coal,d
816,And if I can share more expertise that we have in Texas and the south related to wildfire hazardous fuel reduction and prescribed burning,n
817,Second did the Department of Energy sufficiently monitor the financial status of Solyndra after loan disbursements began particularly as the market forces seemed to be against them,p
818,PSEG our company our company is already beginning to invest heavily in alternative energy,d
819,As a consequence of the RFS we are now just 45 percent dependent on foreign oil for our liquid transportation fuels,n
820,Because the States want to be able to enforce requirements on others where they dont have control in their own jurisdiction to make sure that their neighboring States or regions are reducing the emissions,d
821,The Presidents own energy secretary the Presidents own energy secretary says Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,d
822,MERGERSCONVERGENCE MERGERS PUHCA restricts consolidations between electric and gas utilities operating in the same market again the SEC has been lax in enforcing this restriction,n
823,And in fact even as we speak here this afternoon officials in Louisiana are still waitingstill waiting for the Federal Government to provide millions of feet in boom to approve an emergency permit to fullynot partiallyimplement their plan to dredge and build a new barrier island to prevent even more oil from reaching their marshes and wetlands,d
824,Every time DOE issues a new rule it issues a press release estimating the rules benefit in cost savings for consumers and energy savings for the Nation based on theoretical models,n
825,No matter what decision we make on Yucca Mountain we still have a nuclear waste disposal issue,n
826,This will result in higherthannormal gas commodity prices even if the winter is relatively mild,p
827,Again we dont have a tax imposed on a person who buys a gas guzzling SUV but we have a gas guzzler tax that we impose on an automobile,d
829,For example todays efficiency standards for medium and heavyduty trucks are reducing emissions from those vehicles,p
830,Instead we develop runoftheriver hydro a smallscale hydro wind and wood waste power and they produced three times as many jobs,d
831,Environmental concerns are extremely important because energy production and consumption involve major externalitiescosts that are not easily reflected in market transactions,d
832,It is affecting a lot of other industries that depend on natural gas as either a raw material or as a fuel,p
833,I would also like to remind everyone that this is a pilot project a 2year pilot project which I think will give the Department of Energy adequate time to assess the situation and it certainly would be of benefit to our country,n
835,Our agreement builds on XTOs nearly quarter century of success in developing affordable reliable cleanerburning US unconventional natural gas supplies for use by Americans,p
836,We had better find a way to use coal in a clean manner,p
837,This KXL scheme is equivalent to a 4 billionayear tax on the oil we are already getting from Canada with all the money going from American wallets and pocketbooks to oil companies,n
840,Second my second point the rising US gasoline prices has come at a time of soaring US gasoline production,p
841,Significant pillars of our program are deployment of nonCOINF2INF sources of generation like renewables and nuclear reduced COINF2INF emissions through efficiency and the COINF2INF capture from fossil fuels,n
843,And this is a key moment for the committee to play a role in addressing climate change and this bill does make several key investments for our energy future although I am willing to entertain more possibilities,d
844,Anticipating efforts in the first half of 2006 particularly in the first quarter and moderating energy prices will create a seesaw effect for the US economy and manufacturing,n
845,I think the increased production has been very good for our economy but my concern is that the technology that we need to keep production cleanby clean I mean carbon greenhouse gas emissions from production greenhouse gas emissions in transportationthat they are not there to keep up with the demand that would increase if we lifted the export ban,d
846,We had great debate over whether this administration the Obama administration is hostile to energy production on land offshore and on Federal lands etc and the argument that that is the case is not supported by the facts,n
847,Commander Lippold are you concerned that this legislation essentially permanently lifts the ban even though we may start to see a decrease in oil production as early as the 2020s,d
849,We know from past statistics that the solar industry is in the top 10 growing industries in our country,d
850,And are you aware of the significant concerns because I know I have heard a lot about it with the pending regulations and their impact on the affordability of wood wood heating,n
851,Timely advance in clean coal technology will require significant cost share funding for research and development projects and demonstrations of emerging technology and tax incentives to reduce the risks and encourage early development and refinement of the new technologies,p
852,There is a great controversy right now Congressman over the Environmental Protection Agencys proposed rules for particulate emissions from coal plants and also greenhouse gas emissions,n
853,The Department of Energys 32 billion budget proposal serves as a reminder of the broad range of defense science energy and environmental activities that your agency pursues to perform its really important critical I would say national and energy security missions,n
854,I would imagine just engaging in the economywide outcome with carbon pricing Ms Palmer,n
855,I want to hear whats fair when you shut down a coalfired power plant and it destroys the fabric the economic basis to run a school system in a county when millions of dollars are lost,p
856,He has added substantially to the states ability to deal with our current energy situation,n
858,Hydro provides six to seven percent of all electricity generation and nearly half of all renewable generation making hydro the largest provider of renewable electricity,d
859,Michael C Burgess Congress established the Corporate Average Fuel Economy program in 1975 to improve vehicle fuel economy reduce oil consumption and secure the Nations energy independence,d
860,Last fall we published a report Biofuels Issues and Trendsit is attached to my testimonyto provide an overview of the dynamics of production consumption trade in ethanol biodiesel and cellulosic fuels,n
865,Joe Barton Chairman Committee on Energy and Commerce Thank you Mr Chairman for holding this hearing to determine the current status of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline,n
866,Muir is concerned only about carbon,n
867,Now let me share some of our observations about the futures markets specifically for heating oil and natural gas,n
869,EPAs greenhouse gas rule will impose a de facto ban on construction of new coal,d
870,We greatly appreciate the bipartisan support for coal in the Committee as reflected in both the Housepassed version of HR,p
871,Of course some might argue that there is big difference between running a coaltochemicals manufacturing facility and a coaltoelectricity power plant,n
872,The only real downside to nuclear energy is figuring out what to do with the waste,p
873,I mean it seemed to me we ran a 2 to 3 natural gas for a long time,n
874,Let me ask you point blank does it make sense for us to have a regulatory structure where it costs almost four times as much to license a hydropower plant as it costs to license a new natural gasfired plant,p
875,And the clean energy sector employed roughly three times more workers than the fossil fuel sector in 2019,d
877,If you want to expand on that and also doesnt a twotier system basically already exist since all clean resources other than nuclear have outofmarket payment subsidies and everything that impact their bid price,d
878,You are quoting an unnamed energy publication,n
879,Now were focusing on climate tact and climate energy,d
880,So now that youre on the job I wanted to ask you specifically do you believe that greenhouse gas emissions endanger the public health,n
881,bullet Allowing economies of scale in manufacturing installation operation and maintenance of renewable energy facilities,d
882,In the energy study that was conducted last summer after the price spikes like we saw in California they found that a 25 percent reduction in their usage at peak times would have saved Californians 700 million last summer,n
883,Yes it is in my opinion highly likely that any living thing that is exposed to high enough concentrations obviously if it is oil and dispersant mixtures are very likely to be poisoned,d
884,We do need to streamline the regulatory process for liquefied LNG exports,p
885,A more predictable rational and flexible air quality permit process including reforms to newsource review will allow for more investment in domestic facilities including carbon capture and a stronger domestic manufacturing base instead of production in other countries who dont share our countrys commitment to stewardship,p
887,Energy demand growth over the past 20 years has been met by the steady exploitation of the large investments made during the last energy boom period in the 1970s,n
888,Do you agree or disagree that it is too late to prevent the carbon dioxide emissions from increasing to 450,d
889,This program would establish a unique partnership between government and industry to help ensure we meet midterm gas demand through the development of technically challenged but potentially prolific provinces,p
891,On the other hand keeping the focus on energy efficiency is not easy when energy prices are low,n
892,Putting the current situation in a broader more positive perspective however the US has some of the cleanest and least costly fuels in the world,p
893,Congressman to me the answer to your questions depends on what your view of future fossil fuel prices are,n
894,And on the battery side it is really beautiful because we are very fuel agnostic,n
895,It has been 30 years since Congress designated Nevadas Yucca Mountain as a secure site for our Nations nuclear wastewater,n
896,This simply reflects the large amount of capital necessary to find refine and distribute petroleum products,d
899,Second I do think that green coal and carbon sequestration is the most important single breakthrough we could make because the objective fact is China is adding one coalburning plant a week,p
901,However the point of both the Minorities in Energy Initiative as well as my workforce bill is that it really shouldnt matter who is in the White House that the agency DOE has the affirmative responsibility to work on increasing opportunities for all,n
902,Mr Robo you mentioned that you are managing the largest solar bank in the world is that right,n

904,The goals are to reduce foreign oil imports and improve air qualitynot subsidize American industry,n
905,We employ really goodpaying jobs and it is not quite clear to us whether we are qualified under that but certainly we would think we should be because as a result right now there is about 6500000 barrels of oil of refining capacity that is being built outside of our borders much of which is being targeted to come into this country so if we dont have some similar protections and some guidelines we are concerned about leakage and ultimately increasing imports at the expense of our domestic production,p

910,As potential vulnerabilities emerge in the Nations utility distribution infrastructure ensuring reliable sources of energy for our installations has become increasingly challenging,n
912,So if that were correct and I dont disagree with you on that coming from a coal State but if that is correct then why are we having policy that is moving us in that direction,n
913,Likewise in Puerto Rico Hurricanes Irma and Maria uncovered the intensified issues associated with aging and inefficient energy infrastructure contaminated sites that are rapidly multiplying landfills that are already overflowing and possibly the most contaminated drinking water supply in the United States,n
914,Our investments are designed to deliver and promote reliable marketavailable policies practices and life cycle cost effective technologies that will permanently reduce a trajectory of US energy demand growth and carbon footprint of the built environment while maintaining strong economic growth,d
915,But I think you would agree with me that it has been in about the last 10 years or so that it has been used a lot more than it had been because of the necessity of getting some difficult natural gas out of the ground,p

932,Im surprised Mr Garman didnt sort of agree with what I told him about petroleum,n
933,Activated carbon is a specially prepared product of coal or biomass that is able to adsorb many chemicals from gases or liquids,n
934,My home State of New Jersey has a draft energy master plan that calls for the electrifying the building sector by 2050 and reducing the reliance on natural gas for heating homes and buildings,d
935,For example advanced nuclear technologies might be one thing that you could put into repower an existing fossil generating plant like that,d
936,Shell was one of the first integrated oil companies to acknowledge the impacts of human activity on the climate and we believe now is the time to act,n
937,Either Tippy dam in Michigan or the Bull Shoals dam and hydro project in Arkansas on the White River,n
938,But it is now 2015 and global and domestic oil markets have changed significantly we would all recognize that and SPRO needs to be modernized,n
939,While I have said on several occasions that the Yucca Mountain project merits independent and objective oversight I am also concerned that this Subcommittees myopic focus on Yucca Mountain has diverted its attention from other pressing nuclear safety issues,n
941,Then the President issued two executive orders intended to increase energy production,n
942,US dependence on imported oil has fallen since the RFS was enacted from 60 percent in 2005 to 40 percent today,d
946,OK Now those greenhouse gas emissions are not only CO2,n
947,Should this final FIP result in closure of the San Juan plant and mine hundreds of jobs will be lost not only in the coal and power industry on the Nation but in the service support industry and public sector as well,p
948,I think all of us are committed to trying to find out what did take place and put the steps in place that are necessary to make this a safersafer and sounder future for us in terms of oil and gas exploration,p

951,Too often lowincome older persons are faced with the choice of risking their health and comfort by cutting back on energy expenditures or reducing spending for other basic necessities,n
952,Well the World Resources Institute doesnt take a particular position on this specific issue but certainly by reducing these upstream methane emissions we could ensure that natural gas is lowercarbonemittingor lowergreenhousegasemitting than coal or oil when oil and diesel fuel is used for transportation,p
955,Massachusettss long and distinguished record investing in energy efficiency is delivering great results,n
