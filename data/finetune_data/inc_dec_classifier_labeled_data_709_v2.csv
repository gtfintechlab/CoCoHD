producing the same oil that then we would have to be paying more for because then it would be coming from another country,n
Last year US production increased over a million barrels a day and if we were to repeal the ban on crude oil exportsnow this is an opinion,p

Thus those tax policies stifled the industry at a time when US energy demand was increasing significantly,n
The US Senate has twice passed a RPS and the majority of Senators on the energy bill conference supported the Bingaman RPS amendment,d

The principal environmental benefits associated with coal gasification as compared to coal combustion processes are in the short term significantly lower emissions of serious air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide NOINFXINF and I should say almost virtual removal of volatile mercury,p
So for instance one of my companies Sun Drop Fuels has adopted a different model so they went to Chesapeake a natural gas company because they are going to use natural gas as part of the feedstock in their plant,p
Although more than half the increase in natural gas consumption between 2000 to 2020 is expected in the East the Westincluding Canadian imports and most of the Gulf Offshoreis expected to provide approximately 80 percent of the incremental lower 48 natural gas supply in the reference case,p
Chairman Meserve I have got a series of questions about the transportation of nuclear waste,n

I look forward to working with you on these exciting new initiatives to take action on climate change and expand our clean energy economy,d
The markets are so tight though that if we can moderate demand a little bit our analysis using the same computer models that DOE uses indicates that with 4 to 5 percent energy savings we can reduce these prices over the next decade by 20 percent or more,n
And that is the kind of dual standard that the Republicans want us to accept even as oil has dropped from 57 percent imported to 45 percent imported since Bush walked out the door in January,n
And what is the US consumption of gasoline per day,n
Also because Kansas allows local utilities to flow through the cost of gas to consumers the ratepayers experienced dramatic increases in the cost of natural gas during the winter seasons,n
So I would just ask that you go and pursue the administration policies that are killing energy production and causing higher gas prices instead of going to Saudi Arabia,n
Senator Daschle has introduced S 670 which adopts an ethanol mandate similar to the approach to S 2962,d
The concern I have I have expressed it many times on the high cost of natural gas and not only for heating our homes or cooling our homes if you are in my area of the country but also for the feed stock for our petrochemical industry,p

Our notforprofit independent status precludes me from choosing between fuels,n
Considering the nations maximized operational capacity increased reliance on imported oil and strained refining infrastructure any complicating factors in the gasoline distribution chain refining outages or multiple smallmarket fuel formulations can easily impact overall supply and consumer costs,n
These plants have proven to be highly reliable in all weather conditions costeffective in operation and act as crucial anchors to the national electric grid,n
As our country pursues interim storage solutionsand ultimately a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuelit is critical that we ensure the funds necessary to safely transport and store this material are available,n
Our aim is to strengthen energy markets and encourage innovation throughout the electricity sector giving consumers more choice and greater control over their energy decisions while also benefiting the environment,n

As you will hear today however we believe that elements of the alternative fuels discussion draft as currently constructed will not fully achieve those objectives and may ultimately be counterproductive,n
They are the ones who bear the brunt of higher energy prices and supply disruptions,n
So can you explain to why you thinkyou know I realize you decrease emissions but I just am not convinced that that particularly will change much the overall lifecycle of carbon emissions with the batterythe development of the batteries and what it costs to do that when you plug it in how the power is generated,d
In fact a new EIA Commission Study concludes that oil refiners would have quote no problem quote meeting a requirement to produce 95 RON gasoline beginning in 2022 and assumes that refiners would meet that standard with E10 gasoline,p

We do send ethanol by barge as well but I think in this particular study what we are looking at is toxicity,n
Of course we are always concerned about keeping gasoline as affordable as possible and some critics of oil exports have raised fears of price spikes,p
Mr Linn and Mr Duplessis obviously with this being the largest oil spill in the history of our country theres lots of media attention,n
The Clean Power Plan I think makes a lot of sense moving forward,d
And three accelerate the deployment of clean energy infrastructure,d
I think in the latter part of December in the midcontinent area if you went out and tried to buy gas it was very difficult,n
So what we say is we support a vigorous RD program both in reactor development and in recycling reprocessing spent fuel,d
As the FERC commissioners make clear in their letter a thorough assessment of the impacts of for example the proposed Clean Power Plan requires the ongoing input of diverse perspectives and expertise,n
We dont harness the electricity we can from natural gas we dont sell it we dont pull it up we dont benefit the economy from it,n
We have frequently analyzed the consequence of lower world oil prices on different regions of the world,n
So I am a bit confused because Ms McCabe testified that the EPA found that fuel efficiency technology development was moving faster than they had expected and is being implemented in the early years of the program,n
There have been provisions I have disagreed with and think we should revisit like on biomass from forests not counting toward renewable fuel standards seems to be rather absurd,d
Well let me just ask you this then are you basing determinations on LNG exports in part on those discussions with the G7 nations,n
Why should we wait for a great big energy bill which may or may not come during your lifetime and mine,n
One industry study estimates that there will be 600000 career opportunities for women and minorities in energy in the years ahead,n
We know that Chinas use of coal and the world has grown from 20 percent to about 30 percent now and it is expected to get to use 40 percent of the worlds coal in the next 15 years or so we know that Chinas emissions have grown by 80 percent since 1990 and they are expected to grow another 65 percent by the year 2020,n
What we also do is allow forwhat the legislation does it allow for technology limits 60 percent I think to one technology 90 percent for two and what that is doing there is saying that although wind today is the cheapest form of renewable power generation ultimately because of these cost curves you want to induce more competition and to see oil prices continue to come down,d
fuel receipt and the transportation systems to be compatible with the currently NRC licensed storagetransportation systems then they could classify the fuel in those systems as nonstandard causing that fuel to lose its place in the DOEs fuel acceptance queue,n
It goes actually to the heart of what I have talked about which is when you look at energy independence and we look at developing as part of a national security strategy and having an energy policy when you look at those refineries and 30 percent being owned by foreign interests when you look at 30 percent of our oil or 27 being imported into the United States if you want to look at it at a freemarket perspective we dont have a free market,n
Im frustrated that the Bush administration is decimating important R D programs and not establishing realistic and attainable goals for our energy future,n
And I guess it is a fine line between market uncertainty and price gouging in many of our minds because people price gouge because consumers are uncertain and they know gas costs are rising correct,n
Diesel trucks are paying 450 a gallon for diesel,n
Governor Corzine has made it clear that lowering energy prices is important for our economic Mr Shimkus,n
They must strike a demanding balance between first cost cost of operation and technical features to minimize energy consumption,n

So this war on coal must stop,p
We are the worlds largest economy but if we do some things that are very draconian on our emissions here in the United States and really all it does is cost us jobs I am very skeptical that the rest of the world is going to follow suit,n
There is no question that the oxygenate ability of ethanol is a positive,d
Under this scenario a state could never achieve attainment status with its own efforts rather the ability of states to reach attainment would depend on the willingness not only of other states but also of nations around the globe to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,n
If we really do something about climate change by reducing COINF2INF emissions and reduced demand for oil can that help us restrain the price increases of oil,n
We can all agree that we do need some oil and gas development,p
NRC currently bills its licensees or applicants about 263 per hour which is a high burden on companies seeking to develop new nuclear technologies,d
Are weas we move forward in supplementing initial fuelsalternative fuels,n
Instead what weve learned from a steady stream of press reports and congressional hearings is that bullet EPA in fact concluded that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public welfare and submitted its finding to OMB in December of last year,d
Reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is the right move to make but we should focus on that goal and not lose perspective,d

Chairman Shimkus I would like to point out one in particular the suspension of the Nuclear Waste Fund which we argued we needed to do,p
Production off Louisianas shore alone contributes an average of 5 billion a year to the Federal Treasury and that was when oil was less than the 68abarrelplus today,p
I also urge that any proposal considered by this committee have the best interests of electricity consumers in mind including the promotion of conservation and renewable and innovative energy sources,d
So the advantages that you would get from lets say maybe keeping a lid on the Brent price which affects gasoline pricethat advantage still exists and meanwhile the refineries are still operating,p
New teams will come with expertise something like auditors with expertise in energy trading something like that and if they wont perform theyll be thrown out,n
Mr Caruso your testimony focuses on the supply side of natural gas,n
We are currently bound to a petroleum infrastructure and before drivers will purchase a fuel cell vehicle they have to have confidence in a hydrogen refueling infrastructure,n
Also consistent with NPC recommendations the program promotes maximum collaboration between the federal government industry and academia and it establishes a program that is an order of magnitude larger than the Department of Energys existing gas supply RD program,n
So in a tangible way the natural gas prices do affect our operations because of the energy costs,n
So we could take compliance I think from their current permit applications or new permit applications from generating stations and take that data put it into a database and ultimately from that use it to determine a greenhouse gas performance standard for particular plants that were into the interconnect,n
Could we talk for just a minute about the energy policy that is being followed by this administration,n
It is our ability to capture opportunities in lowcarbon technology reduce dependence on imported foreign oil and catalyze improvements in productivity more broadly,p
As states get closer to the implementation date for their fuel programs the greater the temptation to change the date rather than deal with the uncertainty,n

In some conversations that I have had with individuals concerned about some smaller engines those in boats or motorcycles and other specialty vehicles they have had trouble running on even blends with 10 percent ethanol,p
Above all the rhetoric and the different reasons why many of us oppose the Yucca Mountain project this committee and this Congress must ask itself whether the Nuclear Waste Policy Act has been followed as Congress intended,n
American innovation and our abundant energy resources can and should be leveraged to protect our allies around the world from unreliable and unfriendly regimes and promote our interests,n
Along these same lines the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 could be amended to provide the Commission with the sole authority to establish standards for highlevel radioactive waste disposal,d

And you indicated up front that innovation and energy was one of your was one of your goals,n
The American Gas Association represents 192 local energy utility companies that deliver natural gas to more than 53 million homes businesses and industries throughout the United States,n
The result has been policies that deter and forestall increased usage of natural gas which is after all the nations most environmentally benign and costeffective energy source,p
For the first time in six decades the United States is a net natural gas exporter,p
In addition we need to take into account potential threat to the security of gas deliveries to consumers that will occur if we place a greater demand on our production and pipeline delivery capabilities than we have resources to meet,n
When Mr Fawcett and maybe someone else was talking about the oil overseers after the American and Norwegian left and there was only the French and Russian and there was implication there that then they were being selfserving that is incorrect,n
Some of these accomplishments include the fact that as you mentioned Johnson Space Center with the help of FEMP technical assistance and through the use of our AFFECT which is Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies program through the use of our Federal Energy Efficiency Fund authority was able to provide 47 million of investment,d
This of course means that we will have to have an increase in nuclear waste and we need to safely store it,n
Today Big Oil and Big Coal have been working with the Republican thought police to comb through each and every reference to global warming pollution in the Clean Air Act and then disappear them sending scientific consensus down the memory hole at the expense of public health and welfare,d
And so figuring out a mechanism to make sure we can do the work necessary to be able to fully use hydropower is critical,d
But the idea is to produce or to construct a coal gasification facility that will simultaneously produce electricity and produce hydrogen,p
Just as an illustration to make it as clear as I can with a chart that looks fairly complex I will try to simplify it at just how dramatic the changes are that I refer to in thein what is happening today in clean energy,n
The mismanagement for example of nuclear waste clean up processes has been an ongoing Department of Energy problem across several Administrations,p
This initiative requires relatively modest federal investment in nuclear energy research and development,n

This authority is vested in the Secretary of Energy and has been delegated to the assistant secretary for fossil energy,n
My advice to you would be that there would be incentives for the continued investment and development of technology to reduce carbon which does not yet exist,d
So to the extent the administration is supportive of incentives to increase these alternatives whether it be geothermal or solar or wind they can provide an extra cushion and certainly with a hydrosystem and wind projects allow us to store power as you know in the water and allow us to shape the power curve,d
Again less American jobs more dependence on foreign oil,n
In any event I would like to say that I am pleased that our agenda has shifted from a debate over whether to abolish the Department of Energy or to sell off the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to a more prudent and national debate over the national energy policies,n

S 389 extends the existing credit and creates a second drilling window that also applies to heavy oil,n
But our bipartisan group has reached out and said you solveyou give us a waiver on ethanol,n
Because they will now have the controlling interest in that oil field so they can do what,n
And of course it is troubling as a consumer but also I mean I guess because of theof 10 percent ethanol I spend a lot of time at my lawn mower repair shop Lowerys Motors in Lewisville Texas and he said that the ethanol in gasoline had been very good for the lawn mower repair business or the small engine repair business because he gets a lot of business,p
This outdated physical integration requirement prevents utility companies from investing capital outside their geographic region shutting off a valuable potential source of domestic capital investment in needed energy facilities and ironically fostering the very kind of concentration in regional energy markets that FERC is trying to reduce,n
And I hope that we can find new ways to use coal even cleaner than we are using it today,p
I will make a comment from the perspective of energy efficiency,n
I was sitting here listening thinking of a hearing we had not many weeks ago and Mr Greenspan was with us talking about the current situation with natural gas supplies and pricing in this country,n

As shown in Figure 3 two consequences of this flat production have been significant shortterm increases in natural gas prices reaching to near 1000MBtu combined with a substantial increase in its longterm price trend,n
That invisible oil slick is now causing the oceans to become acidic,d
Page 11 of your testimony you recommend that Congress require the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee CASAC to comply with the Clean Air Act Section 109d and advise the Administrator of any adverse public health welfare social economic or energy effects which may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of air quality standards,n
And Section 401a1 of the Clean Water Act precludes the Commission from licensing a hydroelectric project unless the project has first obtained state water quality certification or a waiver thereof,n
By definition costeffective conservation is less costly than any other energy resource and conservation reduces consumers bills,n
But certainly it is important right now during this time of needed supply with questionable reliability to have any and all energy,n
We have a great record in the Northwest on saving energy through conservation,n
For example we believe that production tax credits for renewables should be extended at least ten years and apply to as broad a spectrum of renewables as possible,d
It is somewhat more complex and if you are familiar with how DOE is organized Mr Stupak the vast majority of work at the Department of Energy including our nuclear weapons work our research laboratories Mr Stupak,n
It has helped integrate renewables online,d
Its very simple Because they have no incentive whatsoever to give access to the resources to oil companies,d
And we under this plan would not have the flexibility to build a new coal plant if natural gas prices go up because the technology is not available to be able to do it in an economic way that would make it possible to do it,n
In San Joaquin Valley the stationary sources which include agriculture oil and gas production your ma and pa operations all the way to your biggest manufacturing they make up only 15 percent of the pollution now because we have imposed the toughest regulations in the nation on them,n
Creation of a governmentindustry partnership to pursue two short term objectives resolving technical andor economic issues associated with the new nuclear plant designs and validating the new licensing processverifying that it works as intended and will not place private sector investment at risk,d
In any event we recognize that projections of energy markets are highly uncertain and are subject to many random events that cannot be foreseen,n
Secondly the other consistent thing in that report as I stated earlier is the natural gas impact is having on the marketplace in general in terms of retiring old inefficient plants,n
Our staff closely tracked the markets to make sure that no one took advantage of the situation to manipulate the energy markets,n
In our particular area if you think of wind turbines or solar panels or efficient gas turbines those rare Earth minerals are not actually a major component of our decision making in where to locate,n
As you are aware ConocoPhillips supports passage of a comprehensive Federal law establishing a clear and transparent price for carbon,n
As I say in the blueprint here using energy more efficiently is akin to developing more fuel,d
I am pleased to report that last week the House overwhelmingly passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018,d
Just a few short years ago many would have scoffed at the suggestion that America could produce enough domestic energy to expand its exports or that low natural gas prices would induce a manufacturing renaissance,n
First it is the tax subsidies for unconventional energy that by far have the most detrimental effects on markets prices and consumers,n
Regarding regional impacts of an RES also raised in many of the opening statements different parts of the country have access to different types of renewable energy with different cost and performance characteristics,n
The experts EPA and the National Academy of Sciences have already drawn the conclusion that especially in the short run when we need greenhouse gas reduction the most corn ethanol is increasing emissions by increasing the amount of carbon that is released into the atmosphere,d
On the third page of this document listed are two independent spent fuel storage installations,n
You can obviously absorb excess spikes in natural gas prices for a while and indeed many have done that over the last number of years,p
If we want the industry to be capturing carbon in 2020 shouldnt we be telling them about that now in order to create the market signal,n
I am pleased to present the administrations views on the need for comprehensive energy legislation,n
Members of my local union located in Michigan spent months working on the TransAlaska pipeline which covers 800 miles and carries oil from the North Slope of Alaska to Valdez Alaska,p
We talked about earlier and some of my colleagues talked about the carbon sequestration and how it is notthe technology is not there at this point in time,d
There are a lot of options available to us in the short and long term to produce hydrogen from a variety of different sources and thats one of its attractions,d
And what we need to do is focus on how can we most efficiently reduce consumption and help reduce those overall energy costs,n
For illustrative purposes 43 quads is equivalent tobullet Over 20 million short tons of coal or enough coal to fill a coal train of railroad cars almost 2000 miles longbullet 418 billion cubic feet of natural gasbullet Almost 35 billion gallons of gasoline or more than 10 days of US gasoline consumptionbullet Almost 10 hours of the entire worlds energy use based on consumption levels in 1996bullet Nearly half of the approximate annual primary consumption of any one of the following states Arizona Arkansas Colorado Iowa Kansas Mississippi or Oregon based on consumption levels in 1996 This 43 quads represents a 39 total annual savings in cooling and a 19 savings in heating or a total heat and cooling savings of approximately 25 billion per year by 2010 given an adoption baseline of 1996,n
He said in his oil statement and again just now that somehow companyan individual company would have to go out and assess the exposure not only to their use of the chemical but to everybody else on the market,n
Again I have those plants I have coal plants but I also have refineries and chemical plants that have another issue,p
For instance over the last several years FERC issued two landmark orders facilitating energy storage and aggregated distributor energy resources participation in our organized wholesale markets,n
Does anybody believe that the coal industry should have the right to put unlimited amounts of carbon dioxide at zero cost into the atmosphere,n
Secretary Moniz I want to talk to you specifically about access and equity in the energy transition,n
Through the Recovery Act we are making hundred million dollar grants in grant funds available to help the transit industry to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions for bus rail cars and other transit equipment,n
As a result diesel vehicles will achieve gasolinelike emissions levels,p
And we also operate the Nations most active LNG important terminal at Cove Point Maryland,p
We cannot simply solve this crisis without focusing increasing our energy efficiency,n
The company also engages in new hydropower development through the building of new plants at existing dams,d
The money basically comes from private investors in Kyoto party nations like in Europe who choose to get some of their emissions credits through the clean development mechanism by investing in countries like China or India or African countries or developing countries around the world,d
Offering alternatives that must be included by the Secretary is an unnecessary infringement on the agencys authority and expertise but granting this preferential treatment to hydropower interests is patently unjust unfair and inconsistent with every other element of the Federal Power Act,n
Excavation damage is the leading cause of natural gas distribution pipeline incidents,d
And at that time and today state regulators agree that users of electricity from nuclear power plants should pay for the Federal nuclear waste management and disposal program,n
Well I am just in the research and analysis business but I would thinkand my friends in the industry can speak perhaps better but I think the biggest concern or two really one would be that the government is going to stand in the way of infrastructure projects that are needed to get investment in domestic oil and gas production and the second would be uncertainty about regulation of hydraulic fracturing going forward,d
The fact remains it was under Secretary Salazar that BPs initial exploration plan was reviewed and approved by the Minerals Management Service,p
And with Canadas vast proven oil reserves the prospect of North American energy independence is no longer political rhetoric but a promising reality,p
The President proposed a clean energy standard to increase the amount of energy we get from renewable sources of energy as well as from nuclear and advanced natural gas plants similar to what Mr Barton proposed from the last Congress,n
WANO is organized through regional centers and includes every operating nuclear electric plant in the world,n
Energy is the issue and it is one we need to deal with thoughtfully carefully deliberately through the legislative process,n
Whether surface temperatures will increase due to radiativelyactive emissions is not clear,n
I think what the President is most concerned about is that he would like to move the energy agenda forward,n
We may even get some pleasant surprises such as we recently experienced with the shale gas revolution,p
It is a lesson for all of us as we consider the location of new LNG terminals as we become more dependent on natural gas,p
In this case industry recommended that to improve the NSR program we should allow owners of a facility to avoid the requirements of the NSR program if they improve facility energy efficiency or if they invest in a project for pollution prevention or pollution control simply on those bases,n
More recently while on the US Air Force Headquarters Staff I participated in developing and managing the response to the real world cyber attacks against the Department of Defense information infrastructure that came to be known as Solar Sunrise and Moonlight Maze,d
For example if the fuel efficiency of our personal vehicle fleet was 42 miles per gallon today rather than 21 miles per gallon US oil demand would be lower by 4 million barrels per day oil markets would have spare capacity and the impact of any gasoline price spike would be far smaller,d
There are tremendous opportunities for further job growth in the clean energy sector but to harness that potential we need to continue to evaluate and recalibrate Federal policies,d
Id like to talk about one thing that largely did work and thats nuclear energy,d
Independent producers develop 90 percent of domestic wells and produce 85 percent of domestic natural gas,p
In conclusion I would say new nuclear power construction is prohibitively expensive renewable power is variable and not yet scalable and coalfired power plants are under constant attack from the EPA,n
My testimony today will provide a brief overview of the hydropower licensing program and some of the challenges it faces,p
We have seen cases in Pavilion Wyoming and in Dimock Pennsylvania where the EPA has also accused oil and gas operators of groundwater contamination from fracking without sufficient evidence to justify those accusations,p
From a consumers point of view the Nation will be better off if we have a wide range of generation options and let the market work out the most cost effective solution to supplying our energy needs over time,n
If you export natural gas you factor into that equation the effect on US consumers and whether it is in the best interest of the United States,n
So this slide shows how you would replace one nuclear reactor that is 1154 megawatts with wind,d
The changes would inappropriately expand FERCs natural gas authority attempt to undermine States rights and undermine the important role that other Federal and State agencies play in protecting natural resources for the public,d
All of the research that we have done points toward the need for a full portfolio generation options which includes the need for all forms of thermal generation including nuclear and coal,n
About 20 some percent and yet their carbon footprint is how much more for that production,n
As a physician and someone who represents constituents who have experience too many environmental injustices I am committed to working with members of this committee to create a cleaner and healthier environment for all,d
And you will catch some really good fish and some of the best eating you are going to find right there next to the oil rig,p
One way that I believe the commission can help to ensure reliability is through open communication and a strong working relationship with the EPA the Department of Energy the States and NARUC the North American Electric Reliability Corporation or NERC regional transmission organizations independent system operators and industry,n
At the risk of going a little bit off topic for what this panel was asked to talk about which was lowcarbon electricity and carbon capture and storage and renewables I wanted to at least frame the issue as also associated with the renewable fuel standard that was passed by this Congress previously,d
Today we are examining a law the Renewable Fuel Standard or RFS that is driving development of those new lowcarbon renewable fuels,d
This need not be limited to natural gas or other energy products,n
We have partnerships throughout the United States and with universities with national labs with all kinds of differentand other companies as well looking at everything from hydrogen to of course batteries and electrification of the vehicles and what is happening with compact natural gas and everything else,n
And either the oil itself or something in it is whats likely causing this outbreak,d
As Member of Congress from East Harris County and Houston Texas I have just literally hundreds of people who work offshore offshore Texas offshore literally all over the world and along with our infrastructure we still produce oil and natural gas in a very urbansuburban area but we also have refineries and chemical plants who need that product that is being produced,p
We simply cannot support eliminating the RFS program as the draft envisions without a much stronger signal to the market that ethanols role in our fuel supply will continue to grow,n
Since the drafts release the Environmental Protection Agency has issued a finding that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare,d
Can you elaborate why this makes such a difference for your members in providing greater certainty to prospective purchasers for redevelopment of petroleum contaminated brownfield sites that are cleaned up under a State program,n
The technology allows older coal plants to be retrofitted to burn cleaner eliminating the hassle of permitting a new power plant,p
Accordingly I request that the Agency work with Congress particularly Chairman Shimkus Mr Welch and me as we try to develop interim and longterm solutions fuel solutions that are good for the environment and good for auto mileage good for the American consumers good for the agricultural and ethanol interest and really good for all impacted stakeholders,d
In recent years we have seen the impact of relying almost exclusively on natural gas based plants for new generation tight gas supply higher prices and backlogged projects for natural gas based plants,d
While the nodrive program did not produce the desired results the cleaner burning gasoline did,p
We will invest in medical research and clean energy technology,d
In the first hearing this subcommittee had this Congress my constituent the manager of a local rural electric cooperativethat is a notforprofit entity for those who are in the businessand a former environmental officer at the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency testified that doing so would increase utility rates for again a notforprofit electricity company by 25 percent,n
It is the utilities driving renewable growth and many other independent power producers driving renewable growth and we can take advantage of those independent power producers through very competitive RFPs and PPAs and certainly with our own facilities,d
But you continue to hide evaporative emissions by even using tailpipe emissions in my opinion,d
Towns which adds some common sense to a currently onerous relicensing process for nonfor Federal hydro projects,d
For these technologies air pollutant emissions will be associated only with the transport of the hydrogen to the point of use,d
Secretary Hogan in 2007 Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act,n
But the good news here is that the shortterm energy markets appeared to adjust rather quickly to the collapse of the largest energy trading company in the world,n
I mean that is why we want gasoline or diesel or biofuels or something,p
And I visited Oregon Techs oneofakind geothermal plant in August and saw firsthand how they are taking advantage of great renewable resources in the Klamath Basin,d
Last year the House included a provision in its energy bill requiring a Federal study into this boutique motor fuel issue,n
We strongly support the need for a comprehensive energy policy that focuses on adequate supply sources to aid strategic industries such as ours,n
Now sir since coming to the EPA I would like to ask you have you met with the American Petroleum Institute,n
Unfortunately due to nonmarket governmental forces giving preferential treatment to certain renewables two of these plants Byron and Dresden are now slated for closure,d
that material out to do exactly what Canada is doing to do exactly what needs to happen on the FremontWinema National Forests where you have more than 200000 acres of federal forestland that is exactly that way buginfested lodge pole pine when that material comes out why in the Devil do we say it is not renewable and cant be turned into pucks like this to help reduce carbon from coal,d
And if I can share more expertise that we have in Texas and the south related to wildfire hazardous fuel reduction and prescribed burning,n
Second did the Department of Energy sufficiently monitor the financial status of Solyndra after loan disbursements began particularly as the market forces seemed to be against them,p
PSEG our company our company is already beginning to invest heavily in alternative energy,d
As a consequence of the RFS we are now just 45 percent dependent on foreign oil for our liquid transportation fuels,n
Because the States want to be able to enforce requirements on others where they dont have control in their own jurisdiction to make sure that their neighboring States or regions are reducing the emissions,d
The Presidents own energy secretary the Presidents own energy secretary says Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,d
MERGERSCONVERGENCE MERGERS PUHCA restricts consolidations between electric and gas utilities operating in the same market again the SEC has been lax in enforcing this restriction,n
And in fact even as we speak here this afternoon officials in Louisiana are still waitingstill waiting for the Federal Government to provide millions of feet in boom to approve an emergency permit to fullynot partiallyimplement their plan to dredge and build a new barrier island to prevent even more oil from reaching their marshes and wetlands,d
Every time DOE issues a new rule it issues a press release estimating the rules benefit in cost savings for consumers and energy savings for the Nation based on theoretical models,n
No matter what decision we make on Yucca Mountain we still have a nuclear waste disposal issue,n
This will result in higherthannormal gas commodity prices even if the winter is relatively mild,p
Again we dont have a tax imposed on a person who buys a gas guzzling SUV but we have a gas guzzler tax that we impose on an automobile,d
For example todays efficiency standards for medium and heavyduty trucks are reducing emissions from those vehicles,p
Instead we develop runoftheriver hydro a smallscale hydro wind and wood waste power and they produced three times as many jobs,d
Environmental concerns are extremely important because energy production and consumption involve major externalitiescosts that are not easily reflected in market transactions,d
It is affecting a lot of other industries that depend on natural gas as either a raw material or as a fuel,p
I would also like to remind everyone that this is a pilot project a 2year pilot project which I think will give the Department of Energy adequate time to assess the situation and it certainly would be of benefit to our country,n
Our agreement builds on XTOs nearly quarter century of success in developing affordable reliable cleanerburning US unconventional natural gas supplies for use by Americans,p
We had better find a way to use coal in a clean manner,p
This KXL scheme is equivalent to a 4 billionayear tax on the oil we are already getting from Canada with all the money going from American wallets and pocketbooks to oil companies,n
Second my second point the rising US gasoline prices has come at a time of soaring US gasoline production,p
Significant pillars of our program are deployment of nonCOINF2INF sources of generation like renewables and nuclear reduced COINF2INF emissions through efficiency and the COINF2INF capture from fossil fuels,n
And this is a key moment for the committee to play a role in addressing climate change and this bill does make several key investments for our energy future although I am willing to entertain more possibilities,d
Anticipating efforts in the first half of 2006 particularly in the first quarter and moderating energy prices will create a seesaw effect for the US economy and manufacturing,n
I think the increased production has been very good for our economy but my concern is that the technology that we need to keep production cleanby clean I mean carbon greenhouse gas emissions from production greenhouse gas emissions in transportationthat they are not there to keep up with the demand that would increase if we lifted the export ban,d
We had great debate over whether this administration the Obama administration is hostile to energy production on land offshore and on Federal lands etc and the argument that that is the case is not supported by the facts,n
Commander Lippold are you concerned that this legislation essentially permanently lifts the ban even though we may start to see a decrease in oil production as early as the 2020s,d
We know from past statistics that the solar industry is in the top 10 growing industries in our country,d
And are you aware of the significant concerns because I know I have heard a lot about it with the pending regulations and their impact on the affordability of wood wood heating,n
Timely advance in clean coal technology will require significant cost share funding for research and development projects and demonstrations of emerging technology and tax incentives to reduce the risks and encourage early development and refinement of the new technologies,p
There is a great controversy right now Congressman over the Environmental Protection Agencys proposed rules for particulate emissions from coal plants and also greenhouse gas emissions,n
The Department of Energys 32 billion budget proposal serves as a reminder of the broad range of defense science energy and environmental activities that your agency pursues to perform its really important critical I would say national and energy security missions,n
I would imagine just engaging in the economywide outcome with carbon pricing Ms Palmer,n
I want to hear whats fair when you shut down a coalfired power plant and it destroys the fabric the economic basis to run a school system in a county when millions of dollars are lost,p
He has added substantially to the states ability to deal with our current energy situation,n
Hydro provides six to seven percent of all electricity generation and nearly half of all renewable generation making hydro the largest provider of renewable electricity,d
Michael C Burgess Congress established the Corporate Average Fuel Economy program in 1975 to improve vehicle fuel economy reduce oil consumption and secure the Nations energy independence,d
Last fall we published a report Biofuels Issues and Trendsit is attached to my testimonyto provide an overview of the dynamics of production consumption trade in ethanol biodiesel and cellulosic fuels,n
Joe Barton Chairman Committee on Energy and Commerce Thank you Mr Chairman for holding this hearing to determine the current status of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline,n
Muir is concerned only about carbon,n
Now let me share some of our observations about the futures markets specifically for heating oil and natural gas,n
EPAs greenhouse gas rule will impose a de facto ban on construction of new coal,d
We greatly appreciate the bipartisan support for coal in the Committee as reflected in both the Housepassed version of HR,p
Of course some might argue that there is big difference between running a coaltochemicals manufacturing facility and a coaltoelectricity power plant,n
The only real downside to nuclear energy is figuring out what to do with the waste,p
I mean it seemed to me we ran a 2 to 3 natural gas for a long time,n
Let me ask you point blank does it make sense for us to have a regulatory structure where it costs almost four times as much to license a hydropower plant as it costs to license a new natural gasfired plant,p
And the clean energy sector employed roughly three times more workers than the fossil fuel sector in 2019,d
If you want to expand on that and also doesnt a twotier system basically already exist since all clean resources other than nuclear have outofmarket payment subsidies and everything that impact their bid price,d
You are quoting an unnamed energy publication,n
Now were focusing on climate tact and climate energy,d
So now that youre on the job I wanted to ask you specifically do you believe that greenhouse gas emissions endanger the public health,n
bullet Allowing economies of scale in manufacturing installation operation and maintenance of renewable energy facilities,d
In the energy study that was conducted last summer after the price spikes like we saw in California they found that a 25 percent reduction in their usage at peak times would have saved Californians 700 million last summer,n
Yes it is in my opinion highly likely that any living thing that is exposed to high enough concentrations obviously if it is oil and dispersant mixtures are very likely to be poisoned,d
We do need to streamline the regulatory process for liquefied LNG exports,p
A more predictable rational and flexible air quality permit process including reforms to newsource review will allow for more investment in domestic facilities including carbon capture and a stronger domestic manufacturing base instead of production in other countries who dont share our countrys commitment to stewardship,p
Energy demand growth over the past 20 years has been met by the steady exploitation of the large investments made during the last energy boom period in the 1970s,n
Do you agree or disagree that it is too late to prevent the carbon dioxide emissions from increasing to 450,d
This program would establish a unique partnership between government and industry to help ensure we meet midterm gas demand through the development of technically challenged but potentially prolific provinces,p
On the other hand keeping the focus on energy efficiency is not easy when energy prices are low,n
Putting the current situation in a broader more positive perspective however the US has some of the cleanest and least costly fuels in the world,p
Congressman to me the answer to your questions depends on what your view of future fossil fuel prices are,n
And on the battery side it is really beautiful because we are very fuel agnostic,n
It has been 30 years since Congress designated Nevadas Yucca Mountain as a secure site for our Nations nuclear wastewater,n
This simply reflects the large amount of capital necessary to find refine and distribute petroleum products,d
Second I do think that green coal and carbon sequestration is the most important single breakthrough we could make because the objective fact is China is adding one coalburning plant a week,p
However the point of both the Minorities in Energy Initiative as well as my workforce bill is that it really shouldnt matter who is in the White House that the agency DOE has the affirmative responsibility to work on increasing opportunities for all,n
Mr Robo you mentioned that you are managing the largest solar bank in the world is that right,n
bullet Efficiency Government policies should encourage the efficient use of energy by insuring a level playing field for competing sources of energy,n
The goals are to reduce foreign oil imports and improve air qualitynot subsidize American industry,n
We employ really goodpaying jobs and it is not quite clear to us whether we are qualified under that but certainly we would think we should be because as a result right now there is about 6500000 barrels of oil of refining capacity that is being built outside of our borders much of which is being targeted to come into this country so if we dont have some similar protections and some guidelines we are concerned about leakage and ultimately increasing imports at the expense of our domestic production,p
And a lot of it had to do with deregulating our domestic environment and making a whole suite of challenges and deciding that we were going to commit to this internationally connected and efficient market for oil and gas and things like that,p
In that same hearing Ms Angielski we heard testimony that fossil energy will remain a major part of the energy mix in growing nations like India Vietnam Colombia South Africa because the sources are domestic abundant and affordable,p
Although I recognize the role that nuclear power plays in our Nations longterm energy strategy and the need to properly store expired nuclear fuel I remain strongly opposed to any effort to reinstate Yucca Mountain,p
As potential vulnerabilities emerge in the Nations utility distribution infrastructure ensuring reliable sources of energy for our installations has become increasingly challenging,n
So if that were correct and I dont disagree with you on that coming from a coal State but if that is correct then why are we having policy that is moving us in that direction,n
Likewise in Puerto Rico Hurricanes Irma and Maria uncovered the intensified issues associated with aging and inefficient energy infrastructure contaminated sites that are rapidly multiplying landfills that are already overflowing and possibly the most contaminated drinking water supply in the United States,n
Our investments are designed to deliver and promote reliable marketavailable policies practices and life cycle cost effective technologies that will permanently reduce a trajectory of US energy demand growth and carbon footprint of the built environment while maintaining strong economic growth,d
But I think you would agree with me that it has been in about the last 10 years or so that it has been used a lot more than it had been because of the necessity of getting some difficult natural gas out of the ground,p
Municipal utilities in my Tennessee district saw the cost of natural gas soar to near 10 per million Btus on the spot market over the winter,p
The future will belong to the country that builds an energy infrastructure to support a cleaner low carbon economy,d
The Presidents proposal removes this requirement allowing plants with no pollution controls at all to keep on polluting,d
The C2P2 encourages generators and users of coal combustion products to increase the use of coal ash in cement and other construction products,p
In addition the quadrennial energy review will provide an opportunity to look at obstacles to building gathering lines that would allow you to capture natural gas,p
But I worry that you will labor mightily and give forth with a capandtrade that will produce a carbon price that is too low to affect physical change,n
At the same time Keystone will increase our Nations longterm security by accessing oil from our friendly neighbors to the north from Canada,p
But it still leaves the rest of the number which is the 60 or 70 percent which has come from or will have to come from hydrocarbons using advanced technologies,d
Ultimately Congressman if the Department of Homeland Security felt that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission hadnt moved either quickly enough or effectively enough visavis the threat you are talking about one would hope that the new Cabinet Secretary in conjunction with the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission can resolve that,n
The reference case includes the effects of several policies aimed at increasing energy efficiency in both enduse technologies and supply technologies including minimum efficiency standards and voluntary energy savings programs,n
However it is doubtful that hydrogen demand will increase so rapidly as to adversely affect the supply of natural gas,n
Secondly the volume of trading in the carbon market will be at least 300 times greater than the SO2 market,n
Im surprised Mr Garman didnt sort of agree with what I told him about petroleum,n
Activated carbon is a specially prepared product of coal or biomass that is able to adsorb many chemicals from gases or liquids,n
My home State of New Jersey has a draft energy master plan that calls for the electrifying the building sector by 2050 and reducing the reliance on natural gas for heating homes and buildings,d
For example advanced nuclear technologies might be one thing that you could put into repower an existing fossil generating plant like that,d
Shell was one of the first integrated oil companies to acknowledge the impacts of human activity on the climate and we believe now is the time to act,n
Either Tippy dam in Michigan or the Bull Shoals dam and hydro project in Arkansas on the White River,n
But it is now 2015 and global and domestic oil markets have changed significantly we would all recognize that and SPRO needs to be modernized,n
While I have said on several occasions that the Yucca Mountain project merits independent and objective oversight I am also concerned that this Subcommittees myopic focus on Yucca Mountain has diverted its attention from other pressing nuclear safety issues,n
Then the President issued two executive orders intended to increase energy production,n
US dependence on imported oil has fallen since the RFS was enacted from 60 percent in 2005 to 40 percent today,d
OK Now those greenhouse gas emissions are not only CO2,n
Should this final FIP result in closure of the San Juan plant and mine hundreds of jobs will be lost not only in the coal and power industry on the Nation but in the service support industry and public sector as well,p
I think all of us are committed to trying to find out what did take place and put the steps in place that are necessary to make this a safersafer and sounder future for us in terms of oil and gas exploration,p
This added step of accountability is crucial to keep an account of delays and avoid the increasing backlog of hydropower relicensing,d
On September 21st EPA expanded this effort in order to minimize potential fuel supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Rita,n
Too often lowincome older persons are faced with the choice of risking their health and comfort by cutting back on energy expenditures or reducing spending for other basic necessities,n
Well the World Resources Institute doesnt take a particular position on this specific issue but certainly by reducing these upstream methane emissions we could ensure that natural gas is lowercarbonemittingor lowergreenhousegasemitting than coal or oil when oil and diesel fuel is used for transportation,p
Massachusettss long and distinguished record investing in energy efficiency is delivering great results,n
Throughout the South and Southeast state governments have enacted legislation or implemented new regulations to encourage new nuclear plant construction,d
But in fact the Department of Energy Clean Energy Future study I mentioned above uses the same model run by EIA and reaches dramatically different conclusions,n
The Chair would recognize the ranking member of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Mr Boucher of Virginia,n
Collectively NACS and SIGMA members sell more than 75 percent of the gasoline and diesel fuel purchased by American consumers each year,n
Well just to add on that most of the nuclear plant sites in the country have had to add additional storage capacity either in the form of expanding the pools themselves or how to manage the pools or putting them in what is known as dry cask storage,d
The amount of gasoline that can be supplied to a particular region may be inflexible in the short run because of various limitations on refining and transportation capabilities or product requirements unique to that region,n
For example should we use natural gas directly for transport or convert it to hydrogen first,n
However we remain at a regional disadvantage for access to much of the existing renewable energy options,d
First the nuclear crisis in Japan is now in its fourth week with no end in sight,p
Now we have lowcost fuel,p
In my testimony today I will describe the CFTCs oversight of the energy futures markets,n
Energy efficiency helps meet our energy needs without hurting the environment,n
The conference report established funding for an advanced nuclear fuel recycling program aimed at developing proliferationresistant nuclear fuel recycling and transmutation technologies,d
OTHER ISSUES Many other issues are under consideration with respect to a fuels title in an 2003 energy bill,n
Encouraging the broadest range of fuel technologies is critical to the type of transformational change necessary to improve our Nations energy security,n
And then finally we should encompass principles that do not harm American energy workers that help to enhance their training and capacity to increase their economic success and security,n
Just 10 years ago most ethanol plants capacity was 10 to 15 million gallons per year,n
Some products may not be available in your area for example but I am not sure of how a consumer would know which zone they are in as well as what the energy prices are in that part of the country,n
As an integral part of their transmission systems interstate natural gas pipelines own and operate a majority of the natural gas storage capacity in the United States,n
There has been widespread media reports and even some comments by congressional leaders of gasoline price gouging by gasoline marketers in the wake of Katrina,n
