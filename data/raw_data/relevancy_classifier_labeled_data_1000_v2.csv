I think that is an incredibly positive development and in fact the predictions of all the oil growth that Raymond James and Citigroup have made all assume that those new rules are going to be implemented yet we are going to have this explosion in oil production yet with the production of which offshore is going to be much safer for the workers and for the environment,r
Fortunately I understand that FERC operations have returned to near normal having cleared much of that backlog allowing the commission to turn its attention towards a host of issues ranging from controversial changes to the RTO capacity markets to how new energy infrastructure projects should be evaluated under FERCs certificate policy,r
We recently canceled a clean coal boiler project that is a good example of this potential outcome,r
You heard about the domestic manufacturing of wind turbine components that has also increased dramatically over the last 5 years as the renewable standards have ramped up,r
The consensus decision making rule Prior witnesses at these hearings have suggested that the consensus requirement of the 661 Committee made it difficult to establish effective oversight of the Oil for Food program,i
It can also help ensure that our communities are more resilient to the impacts of climate change as you know well in your State from power outages to flooding and storm surges,i
Our environment and our economy depend on congressional action to confront the threat of climate change and secure our energy independence,r
There is a great deal of uncertainty about the size and availability of crude oil resources particularly conventional resources the adequacy of investment capital and geopolitical trends,r
We have the chance to turn a major liability into a valuable commodity through which the department can generate new revenue to help expand their mission as we move towards energy independence and combating global warming,r
And while it is so exciting to have vehicles that are keyless and others that turn off and on for energy efficiency and others that will be plugged in this committees work is going to have to continue to make sure that we are doing the things we do to keep people safe,i
I guess what I would conclude you said you would not put a roadblock up to exporting coal,r
For example for an average family driving 2500 miles a month a 1 gallon runup in gasoline prices as we have seen in recent weeks takes 120 out of their monthly budget if they are driving vehicles that average 21 miles per gallon but it would only take 60 out of their budget if those vehicles average 42 miles per gallon which is within our technical capability,r
This bill sets out a national strategy to assist US clean energy technology companies with export assistance to find new markets for their products and services and to better compete in the international marketplace,r
You noted at the outset of your tenure at the EPA that your goal was to refocus EPA on its intended mission return power to the states and create an environment where jobs can grow,i
So you do acknowledge that using a lot of fuel does in fact create jobs,r
Whereas much of the risk in developing the traditional telephony networks was shouldered long ago in a market where the incumbents had monopoly power the development and deployment of broadband presents an enormous and immediate financial risk for firms,i
To highlight a few first we should reestablish and expand Federal agency targets for annual improvements and energy efficiency renewable energy and other key metrics and make needed changes to unlock the use of contracting mechanisms that leverage private funds for public efficiency and renewable projects,r
But before March 1979 was the last instance where the NRC received an application for a new nuclear power generation plant,r
She says As a result of shortsighted energy policies poor longterm planning and extensive rolling blackouts in 2020 CAISO petitioned FERC to make changes to its tariff related to transmission priority through California,i
I share Mr Shimkuss concerns about the effect of carbon cap and trade on this economy,r
So here is this switch that when it is in one position for an emissions test it made a change in how this was operational so the emissions would be lower,i
Going further if we aggressively improve efficiency by four or five percentage points then emissions could fall by 250 metric tons about 13 percent of last years carbon dioxide emissions from coal power,r
Public power systems throughout the United States have seen direct economic benefits from deploying broadband networks,i
I want to thank all the witnesses for being here and look forward to hearing your testimony as this committee evaluates the state of our wholesale electricity markets and I yield back,i
Approximately 10 years ago Beaver County started to see the effects of the technological advancements that made developing the Marcellus Shale possible,r
Mr Reicher if we do nothing other than roll back EPAs modest steps to reduce carbon emissions are we at risk at losing the clean energy jobs race with China,i
So againit came up in the other hearing and I do feel obligated to point outthere is a limit to how much energy you can import if everyone is using their system to the maximum,r
Thus those tax policies stifled the industry at a time when US energy demand was increasing significantly,r
Our objectives area to exercise and perform the powers and duties assigned to the IMO under this Act the market rules and its licenceb enter into agreements with transmitters giving the IMO authority to direct the operations of their transmission systemsc direct the operations and maintain the reliability of the IMO controlled gridd establish and operate the IMOadministered marketse collect and provide to the public information relating to the current and future electricity needs of Ontario and the capacity of the integrated power system to meet those needsf participate in the development by any standards authority of standards and criteria relating to the reliability of transmissions systems andg work with responsible authorities outside Ontario to coordinate the IMOs activities with their activities,i
Likewise when insurance companies are able to pull their market power to negotiate lower rates there can be positive results,i
The US Senate has twice passed a RPS and the majority of Senators on the energy bill conference supported the Bingaman RPS amendment,r
Seeing the issues that we have had with our voluntary domestic carbon market I can only imagine how these issues will be compounded when the value of potential offsets increases and we are relying on verifying offsets in the developing world,r
In that case the question that I will find most important is Will moving to a highoctane fuel standard do a better job in incentivizing and creating market signals for advanced biofuels,r
When that merging occurs will we on the Energy and Commerce Committee be made aware of what that structure looks like and how the fund then subsequently is to be administered,i
1013 would create more red tape and delay and would severely reduce protections for rivers and fisheries impacted by hydroelectric generation,r
We need to stop fighting over a diminished pot of money and recognize that our national welfare demands that we enlarge the pot so that no deserving energy technology is starved out of federal RD funding,r
Is it fair to say that Order 1000 provides a structure for other regions of the country to likewise identify and build transmission infrastructure that is needed to bring new renewable resources online,r
A delay will also give time for utilities to avoid what appears to be an overreliance on natural gas,r
Integrity Management Rule for Natural Gas Transmission OPS issued the integrity management rule for natural gas transmission lines on December 12 2003,r
This group spent over two years evaluating and documenting best practices from across all types of energy pipeline systems,r
A 10 percent reduction in environmental management an 8 percent reduction in the Office of Science 86 percent reduction in energy efficiency and renewable energy,r
The principal environmental benefits associated with coal gasification as compared to coal combustion processes are in the short term significantly lower emissions of serious air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide NOINFXINF and I should say almost virtual removal of volatile mercury,r
So for instance one of my companies Sun Drop Fuels has adopted a different model so they went to Chesapeake a natural gas company because they are going to use natural gas as part of the feedstock in their plant,r
There is not existing biology there would be no reason to have organisms involved to do this and pump lots of hydrocarbons,i
Although more than half the increase in natural gas consumption between 2000 to 2020 is expected in the East the Westincluding Canadian imports and most of the Gulf Offshoreis expected to provide approximately 80 percent of the incremental lower 48 natural gas supply in the reference case,r
Nobody disagrees with the need for the additional power,i
But just kind of bottom line we know that for every fullservice hotel like a Marriott we send millions of dollars of buying power back into local communities through the salaries and supply chain,i
Chairman Meserve I have got a series of questions about the transportation of nuclear waste,r
As Ohioans discuss this issue across the state we hear one overriding concern maintaining our affordable reliable power is critical to both the pocketbooks of Ohioans and continued economic development within our state,i
The Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration are fully committed to the homeland security mission and the successful establishment of the Department of Homeland Security,i
In 2006 we actually voluntarily capped our own greenhouse gas emissions,r
Technology can also be a driver for increased energy efficiency and Reps McNerney Welch and Kinzinger have introduced bills that analyze and support new technologies in smart buildings and water systems,r
I look forward to working with you on these exciting new initiatives to take action on climate change and expand our clean energy economy,r
The markets are so tight though that if we can moderate demand a little bit our analysis using the same computer models that DOE uses indicates that with 4 to 5 percent energy savings we can reduce these prices over the next decade by 20 percent or more,r
TESTIMONY OF THOMAS N PYKE JR CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Mr Pyke,i
And that is the kind of dual standard that the Republicans want us to accept even as oil has dropped from 57 percent imported to 45 percent imported since Bush walked out the door in January,r
And what is the US consumption of gasoline per day,r
Also because Kansas allows local utilities to flow through the cost of gas to consumers the ratepayers experienced dramatic increases in the cost of natural gas during the winter seasons,r
Today we depend on these technologies for everything from social interaction to home security the operation of critical services like power plants and the electric grid,i
So I would just ask that you go and pursue the administration policies that are killing energy production and causing higher gas prices instead of going to Saudi Arabia,r
Senator Daschle has introduced S 670 which adopts an ethanol mandate similar to the approach to S 2962,r
The concern I have I have expressed it many times on the high cost of natural gas and not only for heating our homes or cooling our homes if you are in my area of the country but also for the feed stock for our petrochemical industry,r
Each day more exploration and development activity in the Gulf is lost,r
Sincerely Richard A Abdoo Chairman of the Board President and Chief Executive OfficerAttachment Electric Generation Tax IncentivesSeven Year Cost Recovery With regard to depreciation the recovery periods permitted under current law for assets used to produce and distribute electricity are much longer than the recovery periods allowed for other capital intensive industries,i
So that is why I am grateful to you Mr Chairman for crafting the Energy and Revenue Enrichment Act to give the Department of Energy the flexibility it needs to temporarily reenrich tails at Paducah and Portsmouth,r
Question 3 How does the new supply margin market power test in the Commissions order of November 20 differ from the established hubandspoke test for market power,i
As we develop a comprehensive national energy policy efficiency and conservation are definitely part of what needs to be a comprehensive plan that also needs to include the development of our own natural resources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,r
Time of use metering is a similar application of technology which will better help electric customers understand when they use electricity the price consequences thereof and ways to save money,i
Our notforprofit independent status precludes me from choosing between fuels,r
Considering the nations maximized operational capacity increased reliance on imported oil and strained refining infrastructure any complicating factors in the gasoline distribution chain refining outages or multiple smallmarket fuel formulations can easily impact overall supply and consumer costs,r
These plants have proven to be highly reliable in all weather conditions costeffective in operation and act as crucial anchors to the national electric grid,r
Public power also sells any excess power when available in the wholesale market,i
As our country pursues interim storage solutionsand ultimately a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuelit is critical that we ensure the funds necessary to safely transport and store this material are available,r
Our aim is to strengthen energy markets and encourage innovation throughout the electricity sector giving consumers more choice and greater control over their energy decisions while also benefiting the environment,r
My testimony aligns with the following points America is facing two national security threats one around climate change and the other around the US nuclear power enterprise,r
We need metals for our legacy energy businesses our carbonbased businesses oil gas coal whatever,i
As you know Mr Chairman there have been many developments in the Nations energy portfolio since FERC issued Order No,r
But in fact I think it has worked out very well in the electric sector in the sense that we have utilities all other extensions above power systems or at least meeting minimum standards and we saw a good example with Texas this past winter,i
Could you describe the goals of your partnership and also what you hope to learn through these field tests and can you give us a sense of when you think carbon sequestration technology could be sufficiently reliable for deployment and for something we can actually begin to rely upon as we structure legislation that in fact might require the capture and sequestration of carbon,r
Shifting gears I believe the Energy Star program is a nice complement to the mandatory federal energy efficiency standards for many energyusing products in that it helps consumers identify those models that go above and beyond the minimum standards,i
The depressing part of my introduction is I realize I have been at this for 3 decades as part of the House of Representatives staff during the oil embargoes and after I was with Mr Garvin in 1983 and 1984 in the Energy Department running conservation and renewable programs and have been a consumer advocate for the last 10 years,r
Other FreedomCAR challenges include technical market infrastructure and public policy hurdles before fuel cell vehicles are commercially available and DOEs vision of a petroleum free emission free transportation system is a reality,r

FERC grid operators State public utility commissions and power plants even progressive power companies are already planning for the changes that are under way,i
Are these coal refusetoenergy facilities typically located in a smaller community or a larger community,r
It is complete power,i

We are committed to working with Congress to explore ways to maintain or enhance environmental benefits of clean fuels programs while exploring ways to increase the flexibility of the fuels distribution infrastructure and minimize costs,r
The USGS has actively participated in two previous Federal reviews of MTBE and other oxygenates in gasoline,r
They have plenty of power already and influence as they demonstrated by instructing the Republican caucus to go pass this tax bill,i
We are still overly dependent on foreign oil from countries that clearly we have seen especially over the last 15 years do not represent our interests and values,r
Notably the agencies appearing today along with many others signed an MOU in April seeking to establish a cooperative relationship and expedite authorizations of major infrastructure projects including hydropower facilities,r
A leading example is the Energy Star Program which is delivering significant results,r
So only the lobby and one exam room had electricity but they needed full electricity to meet the demands of their patients,i
They include the bioremediation of mixed waste at many of the contaminated DOE sites the witchs brew that we have left from the legacy of cold war also the enhanced sequestration of carbon by the terrestrial and marine biosphere in order to reduce the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and also as has already been mentioned the production of clean fuels such as hydrogen through the miracles of biotechnology,r
My personal opinion based on what happened about that history as well as what happened with privatized spent fuel storage was that you could have a willing host community,i
The first one is that world oil demand has grown rapidly in the last several years putting upward pressure on price,r
To promote economic growth and strengthen security President Obama has called for an alloftheabove strategy that develops every source of American energy,r
Just last month the company was even touted by President Obama for having innovators and creating jobs that will foster our economic recovery and create clean technology to power our longterm prosperity,r
That is something it seems to me the Energy and Commerce Committee and particularly this subcommittee should make a high priority,i
In approving our report Secretary Abraham said The management of the nuclear weapons complex is my most important responsibility as Secretary of Energy,i
Electric reliability and environmental protection are both important to this countrys future,r
I think one of the things just to add is our COINF2INF emissions from energy consumption are down 13 percent since 2007 so this is already actually happening,r

As Chairman Shimkus stated the 21st Century Transportation Fuel Act Discussion Draft takes a larger view of Federal transportation fuel policies,i
Our nations comprehensive energy policy must ensure an affordable reliable supply of energy and nuclear energy provides one of the solutions to several policy challenges that our nation faces,r
Once a public health emergency has been declared MSEHPA allows authorities the power to seize private property for public use that is reasonable and necessary to respond to the public health emergency,i
Soand the other thing I would add is that they are not clean or completely fossilfuel free the way that renewables are,r
Even using power from traditional coal plants to charge a plug in hybrid is environmentally superior for CO2 and criteria pollutants to driving a regular Toyota Prius,r
Hes accompanied by Pat Hoffman Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Office of Electricity who can provide technical perspective from her experience addressing cybersecurity and energy emergency functions,i
As you all know the first export of LNG to scheduled to happen later this month maybe early March at Sabine Pass in Louisiana right next to Texas my own State,r
Given the potential impacts of EPAs proposed rules on the bulk power system such coordination is critical to ensuring that EPA does not enforce its rules in a vacuum,i

We support requiring all lightduty vehicles starting in 2023 to be designed specifically to run on this fuel on at least a 95 octane rating and potentially higher,r
And then let me ask you when you talked about health and safety of the American folks in looking at the endangerment ruling I am wondering if you all looked at the fact because you mentioned something about the heat being higher causing folks to have strokes or heart attacks etc and I am wondering if you looked at the fact that with the electric rates going up the heating bills going up fuel oil going up that there are a lot of folks in my district who are having a hard time paying for their heat and what is the offset on the other side,i
The method can accept a variety of feedstocks including natural gas coal and biomass,r
In early June 2008 the MDH received data from concerned citizens that included measurements of elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide in the ambient air in their community,i
I dont know that we are going to pick and choose the generation sources or the energy sources that is where the American peoplefor other policymakers,r
It is in the national interest and the interest for our economy to get this going and Texans we are understanding of energy issues and the necessity of getting energy to market,r
And there have been a few sites like in Monroe Michigan where there is actually an assembly plant for wind energy,r
Americas hydrocarbon renaissance has given us the gift of time,r
Diesel is the way of the future and I am hopeful that its shortterm benefits will not be overlooked by the Administration or the Congress even as we examine longer term strategies,r
A customer with a basic meter gets no informational feedback on how and when they are using electricity or information they can apply to their future electricity purchases,i
We doare very interested as I said in my remarks want to see the full investigation because we want to understand was there something else people were looking at that caused them to make the decisions they made as opposed to making the decisions that almost any of our drilling operations people would have made differently that led to the ultimate loss of the well,r
Number 2 you have got to have six greenhouse gases so the lowhanging fruit that can be accomplished by changes that reduce other greenhouse gases like methane or NOx any of those the hydrofluorocarbons et cetera can help get rid of it,r
Senator Dorgan you testified that after reviewing several recent studies on the impacts of LNG exports the Bipartisan Policy Center and Energy Board concluded that domestic gas prices are more likely to drive export levels than exports are likely to determine domestic prices,r
No market participant in interstate wholesale electric markets should be immune from FERCs investigative and remedial authority,i
Intense foreign competition from Stateowned enterprises poses another challenge for US companies particularly in the civil nuclear sector,r
Republicans claimed thenjust as they do nowthat the solution was to produce more oil domestically,r
Some are reliably available 24 hours a day and seven days a week and ideal for baseload power while others are not,i
We have also engaged the Department of Interior the Department of Energy the National Laboratories and the Department of Defense in discussions related to security,i
However while we look forward to advanced nuclear technology development it is long overdue to solve our Nations nuclear waste disposal challenge,r
Four US States Minnesota Montana Idaho and North Dakota account for 75 percent of all the natural gas brought into the United States via pipeline,r
Siemens Ford and Volvo have all made engines that reduce particulate emissions by more than 90 percent and nitric oxides similarly remarkably reduced,r
It is helpful to have this update on electricity restructuring issues and I am pleased that transmission issues will be covered in a separate hearing because it is one of the most critical components of any restructuring plan,i
But Cellular South which is our homeowned cellular company and BellSouth which is our biggest provider and also is a partner in Cingular again their people have worked untold hours just like the electric utility people and made huge sacrifices,i
I hope in my discussions with you today that that commitment on my part will come through to you in talking a little bit about what I plan to do and how I plan to bring my experience and my expertise that I have gained in the private sector in the nuclear industry over the years into this project to move it forward smartly in the time that I am in this job and that is my commitment to you,r
We believe to create a truly competitive vibrant energy industry these constraints should be removed,r

test for generation market power Since beginning to grant marketbased rates rate deregulation to public utilities in the 1980s the Commission primarily focused on the applicant and employed a hubandspoke analysis to determine whether an individual entity and its affiliates have generation market power,i
I look forward to todays hearing to examine the challenges and opportunities to modernize our electric grid,i
That is why Canadas oil sands is nearly as valuable as an example of energy policy done right as it is for the oil itself,r
The problem is that if we look ahead and we look at the fact that natural gas is still a fossil fuel comes with CO2 emissions a coaltogas switch will just not be enough to meet our climate goals,r
This bill would require the Secretary of Energy to establish a program relating to the physical security and cybersecurity for pipelines and liquefied natural gas facilities,r
I would want the knowledge and education that allowed me to navigate the system and make my own appropriate decisions for myself and my children and I would want the power to determine my own fate and the power to change the situation,i
Texas Pacific and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts the famous KKR purchased Texas Utility Corporation and agreed to terminate 8 of 11 proposed coalfired power plants,r
The United States has such incredible energy abundance,r
Remove Market Barriers The first problem we need to solve is a procedural barrier that keeps solar energy from accessing the electricity market,r
When they heard about President Obamas proposal to put a tax of 10 on a barrel of American crude oil they all said what the heck what is he thinking,r
In addition we recently received an early site permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission which certifies that our site in Clinton Illinois where we operate one nuclear reactor meets all necessary criteria for construction of a new nuclear unit,r
The fuel diversity should be a cornerstone of our national energy policy as an important hedge against supply disruptions and price volatility,r
Lawmakers must examine the welltowheels cost and impact of EVs from power plant energy distribution to battery disposal,r
As you will hear today however we believe that elements of the alternative fuels discussion draft as currently constructed will not fully achieve those objectives and may ultimately be counterproductive,r
They are the ones who bear the brunt of higher energy prices and supply disruptions,r
So can you explain to why you thinkyou know I realize you decrease emissions but I just am not convinced that that particularly will change much the overall lifecycle of carbon emissions with the batterythe development of the batteries and what it costs to do that when you plug it in how the power is generated,r
In fact a new EIA Commission Study concludes that oil refiners would have quote no problem quote meeting a requirement to produce 95 RON gasoline beginning in 2022 and assumes that refiners would meet that standard with E10 gasoline,r

I am concerned that you all dont get noticed under the Clean Power Plan for interaction about what is going to happen when the plants close down,r
We dont add carbon monoxide to make product look fresh beyond its code date,i
And I know that GE in my district is working on advanced battery manufacturing that will address storage capacity for renewables,r
I hope this doesnt echo across the Administration and the great folks of the Department of Energy and the Congress,i
Adoption of existing test procedures developed through the Energy Star program where energy conservation standards are proposed to be set based on Energy Star performance requirements is appropriate,r
I am president and CEO of Southwest Power Pool an organization for which I have worked 32 years,i
If thats the case for a State like Illinois if 40 percent of the power that we generate is nuclear what would that do to our national energy policy and the pocketbook issues what would it do to the price for the individual consumers,i
Has the RFS reduced the need for foreign oil,r
We see this in the programs that have received proposed budget increases like the 29 billion for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy a 40 percent increase,r
And does that make other forms of energy work better or does it replace them,r
We do send ethanol by barge as well but I think in this particular study what we are looking at is toxicity,r
Of course we are always concerned about keeping gasoline as affordable as possible and some critics of oil exports have raised fears of price spikes,r
That was in my energy business,i
The Federal Power Act requires FERC to balance those competing interests in issuing a license because no one use of a river for power drinking water irrigation recreation or other use should automatically take precedence,i
Rush I think too you know in the future we would do well to include Ms Glover in future discussions because energy efficiency sometimes just kind of gets pushed to the side,i
I look forward to the testimony and to identifying what may be possible to do while preserving the essential roles of heavyduty engine power in our economy and way of life,i
Mr Linn and Mr Duplessis obviously with this being the largest oil spill in the history of our country theres lots of media attention,r

Certainly methane capture from landfills is fairly easy to measure,i
And three accelerate the deployment of clean energy infrastructure,r
One of the crazy things the FDA does not have subpoena power,i
I think in the latter part of December in the midcontinent area if you went out and tried to buy gas it was very difficult,r
So what we say is we support a vigorous RD program both in reactor development and in recycling reprocessing spent fuel,r
As the FERC commissioners make clear in their letter a thorough assessment of the impacts of for example the proposed Clean Power Plan requires the ongoing input of diverse perspectives and expertise,r
We dont harness the electricity we can from natural gas we dont sell it we dont pull it up we dont benefit the economy from it,r

No one has the authority to look at the big picture of how hydro fits into our national energy policy,i
I appear this morning on behalf of the National Association of Convenience Stores NACS and the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America SIGMA,i
We have frequently analyzed the consequence of lower world oil prices on different regions of the world,r
So I am a bit confused because Ms McCabe testified that the EPA found that fuel efficiency technology development was moving faster than they had expected and is being implemented in the early years of the program,r
There have been provisions I have disagreed with and think we should revisit like on biomass from forests not counting toward renewable fuel standards seems to be rather absurd,r
These individuals in turn will become the qualified skilled workforce that the energy and manufacturing industries need,i
Well let me just ask you this then are you basing determinations on LNG exports in part on those discussions with the G7 nations,r
Why should we wait for a great big energy bill which may or may not come during your lifetime and mine,r
One industry study estimates that there will be 600000 career opportunities for women and minorities in energy in the years ahead,r
As you indicated my name is David Duquette and I chair the US Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board Executive Committee,i

We know that Chinas use of coal and the world has grown from 20 percent to about 30 percent now and it is expected to get to use 40 percent of the worlds coal in the next 15 years or so we know that Chinas emissions have grown by 80 percent since 1990 and they are expected to grow another 65 percent by the year 2020,r
That is going to put pressure on conservation,i
What we also do is allow forwhat the legislation does it allow for technology limits 60 percent I think to one technology 90 percent for two and what that is doing there is saying that although wind today is the cheapest form of renewable power generation ultimately because of these cost curves you want to induce more competition and to see oil prices continue to come down,r
fuel receipt and the transportation systems to be compatible with the currently NRC licensed storagetransportation systems then they could classify the fuel in those systems as nonstandard causing that fuel to lose its place in the DOEs fuel acceptance queue,r
I am determined to work with my colleagues to do everything in our power to preserve this important State right,i
It goes actually to the heart of what I have talked about which is when you look at energy independence and we look at developing as part of a national security strategy and having an energy policy when you look at those refineries and 30 percent being owned by foreign interests when you look at 30 percent of our oil or 27 being imported into the United States if you want to look at it at a freemarket perspective we dont have a free market,r
I thank you and the Chair of the full committee for your leadership on the American Clean Energy and Security Act,i
The Agency views the issue of electronics recycling as one of resource conservation and solid waste management and so do CEA and its members,i
Im frustrated that the Bush administration is decimating important R D programs and not establishing realistic and attainable goals for our energy future,r
And I guess it is a fine line between market uncertainty and price gouging in many of our minds because people price gouge because consumers are uncertain and they know gas costs are rising correct,r
Diesel trucks are paying 450 a gallon for diesel,r
Governor Corzine has made it clear that lowering energy prices is important for our economic Mr Shimkus,r
Additional material submitted for the record follows Knoxville Utilities Board and Memphis Light Gas Water DiVision INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY Memphis Light Gas and Water Memphis and Knoxville Utilities Board Knoxville submit this statement for the record of the Committees hearings on electric industry restructuring issues to set forth their views on the need for legislation related to the Tennessee Valley Authority TVA,i
There is a hearing downstairs on energy,i
In addition I believe an amendment to the FPA to give the Commission authority to assess penalties in addition to refunds and interest could act as a powerful deterrent against the abuse of market power,i
They must strike a demanding balance between first cost cost of operation and technical features to minimize energy consumption,r
The other thing we can do is to make sure that any difficulties associated with splashblended ethanol are addressed by allowing us to incorporate ethanol into other ethers for example ETBE,r
So this war on coal must stop,r
Electrifying millions of American buildings will require sensors smart grid solar batteries carbon capture and storage the Internet of Things cloud computing mobile computing edge computing,i
We are the worlds largest economy but if we do some things that are very draconian on our emissions here in the United States and really all it does is cost us jobs I am very skeptical that the rest of the world is going to follow suit,r
There is no question that the oxygenate ability of ethanol is a positive,r
Under this scenario a state could never achieve attainment status with its own efforts rather the ability of states to reach attainment would depend on the willingness not only of other states but also of nations around the globe to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,r
If we really do something about climate change by reducing COINF2INF emissions and reduced demand for oil can that help us restrain the price increases of oil,r
We can all agree that we do need some oil and gas development,r
NRC currently bills its licensees or applicants about 263 per hour which is a high burden on companies seeking to develop new nuclear technologies,r
Are weas we move forward in supplementing initial fuelsalternative fuels,r
Instead what weve learned from a steady stream of press reports and congressional hearings is that bullet EPA in fact concluded that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public welfare and submitted its finding to OMB in December of last year,r
Reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is the right move to make but we should focus on that goal and not lose perspective,r
It took over a year in production and it analyzed all of the various means open to us in terms of investing in energy efficiency technologies,i
Benefiting from the economyofscale by operating and servicing a larger number of nuclear plants within a single organization these companies will be in a position to handle the financial and technological challenges that must be managed in launching the next generation of nuclear plants,r
History is on the side of those who want to act on climate change those who believe in the power of American innovation and our ability to successfully meet any challenge and who look to the future rather than the past,r
Mr Blake we have noted that since the NES was adopted the National Energy Strategy that opened the wholesale markets in electricity the wholesale market has increased by 400 percent and prices have steadily declined in the wholesale market during that period of time,i
There is an analysis that is going to be released in the coming weeks by the National Commission on Energy Policy,i
And I see no way that energy costs are going down,r
Chairman Shimkus I would like to point out one in particular the suspension of the Nuclear Waste Fund which we argued we needed to do,r
Production off Louisianas shore alone contributes an average of 5 billion a year to the Federal Treasury and that was when oil was less than the 68abarrelplus today,r
There were no septic systems no water systems and they ended up drilling their own wells and they become really a problem,i
I also urge that any proposal considered by this committee have the best interests of electricity consumers in mind including the promotion of conservation and renewable and innovative energy sources,r
So the advantages that you would get from lets say maybe keeping a lid on the Brent price which affects gasoline pricethat advantage still exists and meanwhile the refineries are still operating,r
I am privileged to chair the Subcommittee on Commerce Trade and Consumer Protection and my friend and colleague Mr Boucher who is the chairman of the Communications Technology and Internet Subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Commerce,i
We have Mr Adam Sieminski Chief Energy Economist Deutsche Bank,i
New teams will come with expertise something like auditors with expertise in energy trading something like that and if they wont perform theyll be thrown out,r
Mr Caruso your testimony focuses on the supply side of natural gas,r
We are currently bound to a petroleum infrastructure and before drivers will purchase a fuel cell vehicle they have to have confidence in a hydrogen refueling infrastructure,r
Also consistent with NPC recommendations the program promotes maximum collaboration between the federal government industry and academia and it establishes a program that is an order of magnitude larger than the Department of Energys existing gas supply RD program,r
So in a tangible way the natural gas prices do affect our operations because of the energy costs,r
So we could take compliance I think from their current permit applications or new permit applications from generating stations and take that data put it into a database and ultimately from that use it to determine a greenhouse gas performance standard for particular plants that were into the interconnect,r
Could we talk for just a minute about the energy policy that is being followed by this administration,r
It is our ability to capture opportunities in lowcarbon technology reduce dependence on imported foreign oil and catalyze improvements in productivity more broadly,r
As states get closer to the implementation date for their fuel programs the greater the temptation to change the date rather than deal with the uncertainty,r
And he says he bids on a job and he has to be competitive with his bid and then overnight the price of diesel goes up and sometimes it goes up from when he starts the job several times before he finishes the job and there goes his profit,r
You have already got your nose under the tent with the emissions part of the car,r
The recent crisis in California generated great uncertainty in our nations electricity markets and brought to the forefront serious deficiencies in Americas system of electricity transmission generation and distribution,i
As we know natural gas prices have risen sharply and likely will not drop substantially until more production goes on line in the United States,r
In his address to Congress earlier this week President Obama outlined his vision for a clean energy future that will not only help turn around our ailing economy but also drive new investment and job growth for decades to come,r
Last year nationwide production and transportation of gas added 62 billion to Federal and State government revenues and it could elevate to 111 billion by 2020,r
How many are actively involved in producing ethanol or biodiesel portion of the refineries,r
3136 correctly understand the importance of not prematurely reimposing the nuclear waste fee especially given the substantial balance and large investment interest which accrues annually,r
I introduced a bill called the Renewable Energy Jobs Act that will provide pilot programs for training individuals for employment in renewable energy and energyefficient industries on site in these companies,r
These types of facilitiesexempt wholesale generators or EWGsare not considered to be electric utility companies under PUHCA and in fact are exempt from all provisions of PUHCA,i
Over the last decade we have emerged as the worlds leading producer of oil and natural gas and at the same time we lead the world in CO2 emission reductions a fact that proves that energy production and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive goals,r
I want to ask you Mr Chairman and each of the Commissioners can you for the record as short of a guarantee state that the NRC is doing its absolute best to eliminate any and all known threats to nuclear safety in this Nation,i
In some conversations that I have had with individuals concerned about some smaller engines those in boats or motorcycles and other specialty vehicles they have had trouble running on even blends with 10 percent ethanol,r
Above all the rhetoric and the different reasons why many of us oppose the Yucca Mountain project this committee and this Congress must ask itself whether the Nuclear Waste Policy Act has been followed as Congress intended,r
American innovation and our abundant energy resources can and should be leveraged to protect our allies around the world from unreliable and unfriendly regimes and promote our interests,r
Along these same lines the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 could be amended to provide the Commission with the sole authority to establish standards for highlevel radioactive waste disposal,r
It would affect ethanol prices to some extent,r
Long Islands power generation costs are generally higher that those in Connecticut,i
Stockpiling should be carefully investigated by EPA and the exact amount of gas should be deducted from the critical use exemption totals each year,r
Finally we must determine the most environmentally sound methods of increasing energy supplies for our country,r
In 2009 DOE was appropriated about 36 billion under the Recovery Act to increase taxpayer spending on energy efficiency environmental cleanup loan guarantees and various energyrelated research development and deployment projects and activities,r
Could you explain why the FTC thinks it is necessary to have the power to determine the possibility of adverse results without first consulting with the appropriate judge and presenting and seeking such latitude as you are asking for,i
And in order to accommodate the greatest diversity of witnesses as well as use the time we have in the most efficient way considering both of the activities on the House floor and HouseSenate conferences on the energy and the highway bills we are going to bifurcate this hearing,i
Everybody on this panel supports there being not just on stationary sources but on mobile sources like tailpipe emissions for cars and trucksthe industry and labor union that represents UAW supports a mandatory cap and trade system,r
So will it make electricity more or less expensive then,i
This work to better organize the healthcare market into highvalue networks is necessary and desirable and we would urge that folks make a differentiation between consolidation to create excessive market power and integration of providers in the market to create a highvalue network,i
But if only 2 percent of the natural gas escapes through to the atmosphere then we are going to be in worse shape than if we used coal,r
The gasoline sulfur standard is a national annual average standard set at 30 parts per million a 90 percent reduction over current national levels,r
Were very pleased to be here to discuss the final report of the Commission to Review the Effectiveness of the National Energy Laboratories,r
Mr Chairman and members of the subcommittee the agreement that we are announcing today on multiple appliances seeks to legislate new appliance efficiency standards for several covered products recommends to DOE and EPA that they adopt new strict Energy Star specifications for these products and seeks to extend the manufacturers tax credit for super efficient appliances to more products,i
Resource agencies responsible for the health of fisheries have only one chance every 30 to 50 years to affect how private hydropower projects are operated,i
The jurisdictional principal is the root principle of administrative power,i
And you indicated up front that innovation and energy was one of your was one of your goals,r
The American Gas Association represents 192 local energy utility companies that deliver natural gas to more than 53 million homes businesses and industries throughout the United States,r
The result has been policies that deter and forestall increased usage of natural gas which is after all the nations most environmentally benign and costeffective energy source,r
For the first time in six decades the United States is a net natural gas exporter,r
Mr Sokol your testimony says that the problems with Enron shouldnt stop us from doing electricity legislation because these problems are primarily about bad investments and misuse of accounting,i
In addition we need to take into account potential threat to the security of gas deliveries to consumers that will occur if we place a greater demand on our production and pipeline delivery capabilities than we have resources to meet,r
When Mr Fawcett and maybe someone else was talking about the oil overseers after the American and Norwegian left and there was only the French and Russian and there was implication there that then they were being selfserving that is incorrect,r
In the testimony we have submitted for the record we have outlined some of the concerns we have with the electricity situations in California and New York,i
Some of these accomplishments include the fact that as you mentioned Johnson Space Center with the help of FEMP technical assistance and through the use of our AFFECT which is Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies program through the use of our Federal Energy Efficiency Fund authority was able to provide 47 million of investment,r
And research shows that because prescription drugs are manufactured by reputable pharmaceutical companies they are prescribed by licensed clinicians they are dispensed by pharmacists they are perceived as safer to abuse than illegal drugs and we know that is not true and we know that young people arent buying them in a piece of tinfoil from behind a gas station,i
This of course means that we will have to have an increase in nuclear waste and we need to safely store it,r
Today Big Oil and Big Coal have been working with the Republican thought police to comb through each and every reference to global warming pollution in the Clean Air Act and then disappear them sending scientific consensus down the memory hole at the expense of public health and welfare,r
And so figuring out a mechanism to make sure we can do the work necessary to be able to fully use hydropower is critical,r
But the idea is to produce or to construct a coal gasification facility that will simultaneously produce electricity and produce hydrogen,r
So I am going to read you something from the Orange County Register of March 12 2012 In fact Brazilians are spending so much that flights with Brazils top airline TAM originating in the United States have had to carry more fuel to accommodate the dramatically overweight baggage,i
Just as an illustration to make it as clear as I can with a chart that looks fairly complex I will try to simplify it at just how dramatic the changes are that I refer to in thein what is happening today in clean energy,r
The mismanagement for example of nuclear waste clean up processes has been an ongoing Department of Energy problem across several Administrations,r
That is causing heating,i
This initiative requires relatively modest federal investment in nuclear energy research and development,r
I am pleased that both the Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC are investigating Enrons activities,i
Forcing fuel switching from coal to natural gas is a tool of compliance by contrast maximizes the costs of compliance,r
These are carbon dioxide pipes,i
REGIONAL TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATIONS On July 12 2001 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a number of orders which advanced the concept of the formation of four large regional transmission organizations in addition to ERCOT in Texas to better facilitate the movement of electricity within the continental United States,i
The savings from the CAFE proposal like I mentioned is more than three times proven reserves of oil in the United States,r
This is what he said Simply put the Clean Air Act oxygen mandate slows environmental improvement raises costs and is no longer required to ensure substantial and sustained ethanol use in California,r
You would be a real hero if you could get us the energy bill,r
But domestically it has both led to a tremendous renewal in manufacturing170 billion capital invested in just in the kind of the chemical arena and by the way also reducing carbon emissions,r
Renewable fuel standard is putting 36 billion gallons of nongasoline into the gasoline and diesel supply through the next few decades,r
You guys are the guys who can make this happen because of your connection with mostlyyou have some friends over on my side but you have a lot of friends on the Democrat side and they are in charge and so I would plead with you and the other folks who are looking for expansion of energy opportunities the operating engineers the electricians that they hold out for a good bill that they are not going to lose their jobs,r
Well that was under the greenhouse gas requirement but did anyone at EPA consult with the Office of Management and Budget or the White House before moving forward with taking over the flexible permitting program under the Clean Air Act,r
It is time for Congress to provide an updated National Energy policy,r
I am here to speak a bit about the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that nine and soon 10 States in the Northeast have embraced to deal with greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity generation sector in our State,r
In the next 2 weeks large oil pipeline operators will be in compliance with the required baseline testing deadline of the highest risk segments set by the regulations,r
Comprehensive Review and Recommendations Pursuant to Section 603 of the Energy Act of 2000,i

The Commission has been upheld in its interpretation of the Federal Power Act as excluding generation facilities per se from our direct authority,i
I think its increasingly obvious that the word green here in this case really only means low carbon,r
The fossil fuel industry and House Republicans have a credibility problem when it comes to claims about the economic impacts of the Clean Air Act,r
We believe that the first of these recommendations P0001 related to the use of E911 when damage to a pipeline results in the release of gas or other hazardous substance has been resolved with a change to the best practices and recommendations to OPS earlier this year,r
There has been a lot of investment and that has been a lot of indirect jobs that have gone into that in building renewable refinery capacity and it is all happened not at the expense of the petroleum industry,r
The Report notes that The energy burden on lowincome households as a proportion of income is four times greater than for other American households,r
And on top of that we reached an agreement last year with the operator of the three largest coalfired electric generating units in New Jersey that are going to bring major major reductions in emissions from those units,r
Congressman if you dont mind I think I will jump into this first and I would ask maybe to submit for the record the most recent comprehensive study conducted by the Department of Energys Argonne National Lab which looked at all of the energy balance studies that have been done over the past 10 and 15 years and concluded that without question ethanol has a positive energy balance,r
Commissioner Rosenworcel again what should the FCC be doing going forward to make sure the cell towers dont go down during power outages,i
I have introduced legislation with my friend Mr Doyle to make common sense reforms at the NRC to provide existing plants some relief but without a strong domestic industry how do we expect American technology and more importantly safety culture and nonproliferation standards to compete with staterun power companies like Russia and China,r
As the DOE continues to delay honoring its contracts with the utilities to remove spent nuclear fuel from plant sites both the amount of SNF and HLRW stored and the costs associated with storing it increase,r
The exemption recognizes that manufacturing companies are not in the business of generating and selling power and are not creating market problems,i
Unchanged if these power plants shut down,i
And then we have Mr Lou Pugliaresi who is the president of Energy Policy Research Foundation,i
So 2 years and you dont have the records from 2007 and yet you continue to say you dont need subpoena power,i
But as we look at the list of states with a high percentage of carbonbased fuels we look at Massachusetts at 90 better than 90 percent Michigan 86 percent Texas at 95 percent even Wyoming at 97 percent,r
The article went on to note that in just the Bakken and Three Forks plays alone the US Geological Survey estimated that there are 74 billion barrels of recoverable oil and 67 trillion cubic feet of natural gas waiting to be tapped,r
And you know if we look at emissions they really have to be looked at on a global scale,r
The bill would short circuit the established review process for pending and future LNG export applications,r
President The Association of American Medical Colleges The Association of American Medical Colleges AAMC is pleased to submit for the record testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health on the need to replace the Sustainable Growth Rate SGR methodology used to calculate the update for Medicare payments under the Physician Fee Schedule physician payment update,i
Technological advancements on the electrical grid from transmission through end use have helped improve efficiency and reduced emissions,r
We cut back a lot on the energy efficiency programs because we have done so much so far,r
The collateral effects from incomplete or poorly thought out policy changes could have a negative effect on all electricity users and certainly in regions of the country where there are no problems occurring,i
This authority is vested in the Secretary of Energy and has been delegated to the assistant secretary for fossil energy,r
My advice to you would be that there would be incentives for the continued investment and development of technology to reduce carbon which does not yet exist,r
So to the extent the administration is supportive of incentives to increase these alternatives whether it be geothermal or solar or wind they can provide an extra cushion and certainly with a hydrosystem and wind projects allow us to store power as you know in the water and allow us to shape the power curve,r
Power supplies had been disabled,i
Again less American jobs more dependence on foreign oil,r
Between 1990 and 2000 the State of California added 2670 megawatts of new capacity,i
In any event I would like to say that I am pleased that our agenda has shifted from a debate over whether to abolish the Department of Energy or to sell off the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to a more prudent and national debate over the national energy policies,r
Instead as the threat from climate change becomes more and more dire and the scientific consensus of the threat becomes even clearer we are having another hearing focused on the alleged war on coal,r
Did we find a market power abuse in California,i
S 389 extends the existing credit and creates a second drilling window that also applies to heavy oil,r
But our bipartisan group has reached out and said you solveyou give us a waiver on ethanol,r
Because they will now have the controlling interest in that oil field so they can do what,r
And of course it is troubling as a consumer but also I mean I guess because of theof 10 percent ethanol I spend a lot of time at my lawn mower repair shop Lowerys Motors in Lewisville Texas and he said that the ethanol in gasoline had been very good for the lawn mower repair business or the small engine repair business because he gets a lot of business,r
He joined the Texas Railroad Commission which is a major entity that governs energy and oil and gas and he is elected by his colleagues as Chairman of the Agency in September,i
The electricity cost in 2020 under the LiebermanWarner Bill was 28 to 33 percent increase and in 2030 101 percent to 129 percent,i
This outdated physical integration requirement prevents utility companies from investing capital outside their geographic region shutting off a valuable potential source of domestic capital investment in needed energy facilities and ironically fostering the very kind of concentration in regional energy markets that FERC is trying to reduce,r
And I hope that we can find new ways to use coal even cleaner than we are using it today,r
6 Were there violations of the existing reliability rules for the realtime operation of the interconnected power systems,i
I will make a comment from the perspective of energy efficiency,r
I was sitting here listening thinking of a hearing we had not many weeks ago and Mr Greenspan was with us talking about the current situation with natural gas supplies and pricing in this country,r

The first major power plant was returned to service in just under an hour after that and a few minutes later we reestablished a transmission path to New York City,i
These criteria include balancing reasonable cost burdens encouraging lowcarbon technologies providing a uniform national policy and finding the most costeffective ways to reduce emissions without choosing winners and losers,r
This is clear in the repeated attacks on our oil and natural gas industry and its people which has provided tremendous opportunity and driven advances in cleaner energy generation that are benefiting the globe,r
Mr Shimkus asked earlier whether climate legislation would raise gasoline and electricity prices,r
NNSA is responsible for overseeing the approval while consulting the Office of Nuclear Energy and the DOE general counsel in addition to interagency coordination,r
In addition ethanol cannot be carried in the nations pipeline system and must be segregated from the wholesale distribution system until its addition at the truck rack,r
And if we focused our time energy finances resources on helping the entire world and not just the United States we would be moving you know to the future a little faster,i
But for the sake of our consumers our utility businesses and Americas entrepreneurs and innovators we as a Nation could take a better course of action and enact a national energy policy to begin the transition to a lowcarbon economy,r
Do you think that all drinking water systems that are located near wastewater treatment facilities that accept drilling waste should monitor intake water for radioactivity and other potentially hazardous byproducts of these activities,r
What do you see as the Federal Governments proper role in encouraging the use of alternative fuels in vehicles,r

We have a very favorable climate for construction approval siting of new power plants new generating facilities,r
We have been asking for a number of years for the Department of Energy to do the necessary investigations to start making those kinds of determinations and we dont yet have that information in place,r
However the US Congress does possess the power to overturn some of the most important barriers facing Distributed Generation today,i
A big driver for renewable energy development has been the willingness of States to forge ahead despite the absence of federal leadership,r
What I find Congressman Deutsch very unfortunate is that our company who worked very hard in building something that is very unique that whoever the buyer is of our company whether it is Hutchinson One Power Singapore Technologies or it turns out to be somebody else is going to make an incredibly good acquisition because we built a worldwide platform that cost us over 12 billion,i
In addition the NRC explained to our committee staff that the operator was able to avert core damage in the full power loss scenario by activating a steampowered reactor cooling system also known as the RCIC but some NRC analysts have questioned the ability of this system to function when battery power is lost,r

Under the Clear Skies Initiative all Americans will benefit from cleaner air as emissions of the major pollutants from power generation SOINF2INF NOINFXINF and mercury are reduced by roughly 70 percent,r
In order to allow our power sector our engineering sector transportation sector manufacturing sector to do the job that I think in their heart instinctively they want to do we have got to give them the assurance that the timetables we establish have got to be such that they can keep pace with their responsibility to meet the needs of the citizens today and at the same time engage in the research and development of the solutions that we have but do it in a timely fashion,i
But the problem is that even with this particular issue included with the high gas prices we are not seeing any correspondence between underlying costs and prices in the wholesale market,r
The Department of Energy was supposed to select two scientifically appropriate sites one east of Mississippi and one west of Mississippi River,r
From telecommunications to fuel economy standards I have always found that starting with the goal of saving families money through technological innovation is the best vehicle for effective public policy,i
Boutique fuels only result in supply problems when a refinery problem or pipeline outage occurs,r
The environment doesnt benefit and you have these constricted flows and it seems to me it does not benefit anybody other than the industry that is out there designed to shut down any progress on energy development,r
There is clearly a need for a speedier more efficient process for siting approval especially as siting decisions in one state can affect the operation of the electric grid in several other statesas should be apparent from the events of August 14th,i
We have a distinguished panel that will cover all aspects of the issue from coal production to power generation from labor issues to environmental impacts from clean coal technology to consumer impacts,r

Most of all I am very concerned what this proposed rule would do to electricity costs for consumers and for jobcreating businesses,i
Also the ability of utilities to provide affordable and reliable energy and power to people,i
And Section 401a1 of the Clean Water Act precludes the Commission from licensing a hydroelectric project unless the project has first obtained state water quality certification or a waiver thereof,r
By definition costeffective conservation is less costly than any other energy resource and conservation reduces consumers bills,r
But certainly it is important right now during this time of needed supply with questionable reliability to have any and all energy,r
We have a great record in the Northwest on saving energy through conservation,r
And you need to understand how they function and just going in and building a tighter envelopethis happened when I was a code official back in the early 90s is the energy code started requiring tighter construction,i
The Maryland Energy Assistance Program which distributes LIHEAP funds locally is expected to receive 32 million from the Federal Government,i
For example we believe that production tax credits for renewables should be extended at least ten years and apply to as broad a spectrum of renewables as possible,r
It is somewhat more complex and if you are familiar with how DOE is organized Mr Stupak the vast majority of work at the Department of Energy including our nuclear weapons work our research laboratories Mr Stupak,r
It has helped integrate renewables online,r
Its very simple Because they have no incentive whatsoever to give access to the resources to oil companies,r
And we under this plan would not have the flexibility to build a new coal plant if natural gas prices go up because the technology is not available to be able to do it in an economic way that would make it possible to do it,r
In San Joaquin Valley the stationary sources which include agriculture oil and gas production your ma and pa operations all the way to your biggest manufacturing they make up only 15 percent of the pollution now because we have imposed the toughest regulations in the nation on them,r
Creation of a governmentindustry partnership to pursue two short term objectives resolving technical andor economic issues associated with the new nuclear plant designs and validating the new licensing processverifying that it works as intended and will not place private sector investment at risk,r
In any event we recognize that projections of energy markets are highly uncertain and are subject to many random events that cannot be foreseen,r
With respect to investments on the transmission system and the priorities really goes after increasing the capacity of the existing system with great enhancing technologies such as dynamic line rating energy storage technologies reconductoring of our transmission system,i
Secondly the other consistent thing in that report as I stated earlier is the natural gas impact is having on the marketplace in general in terms of retiring old inefficient plants,r
Our staff closely tracked the markets to make sure that no one took advantage of the situation to manipulate the energy markets,r
In our particular area if you think of wind turbines or solar panels or efficient gas turbines those rare Earth minerals are not actually a major component of our decision making in where to locate,r
In another example we believe US EPA has misapplied the economic feasibility analysis to predict the reliability on the bulk power system,i
As you are aware ConocoPhillips supports passage of a comprehensive Federal law establishing a clear and transparent price for carbon,r
As I say in the blueprint here using energy more efficiently is akin to developing more fuel,r
I am pleased to report that last week the House overwhelmingly passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018,r
If we ask any energy trader they will tell you that is the first thing that they look at,i
Just a few short years ago many would have scoffed at the suggestion that America could produce enough domestic energy to expand its exports or that low natural gas prices would induce a manufacturing renaissance,r
First it is the tax subsidies for unconventional energy that by far have the most detrimental effects on markets prices and consumers,r
Regarding regional impacts of an RES also raised in many of the opening statements different parts of the country have access to different types of renewable energy with different cost and performance characteristics,r
This blackout did not arise from a lack of electric generation supply,i
The experts EPA and the National Academy of Sciences have already drawn the conclusion that especially in the short run when we need greenhouse gas reduction the most corn ethanol is increasing emissions by increasing the amount of carbon that is released into the atmosphere,r
We would strongly suggest Mr Chairman that as we talk about these transactions both before the transaction takes place and during the period in which the transaction is being carried out that we have one agency that focus on meeting those responsibilities and that be the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,i
On the third page of this document listed are two independent spent fuel storage installations,r
You can obviously absorb excess spikes in natural gas prices for a while and indeed many have done that over the last number of years,r
If we want the industry to be capturing carbon in 2020 shouldnt we be telling them about that now in order to create the market signal,r
I am pleased to present the administrations views on the need for comprehensive energy legislation,r
There are six principles which we believe are essential to this effort The Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration must ensure that its contractors establish robust effective and reliable business systems promote contractor governance models that adequately protect the Departments interests foster a culture where contractors fully understand and honor the very special responsibility associated with managing taxpayerfunded Federal facilities promote an environment where both Federal and contractor employee concerns can be raised and addressed without fear of retaliation develop quantifiable outcomeoriented metrics and maintain a system to track critical aspects of contractor performance and reward contractors commensurate with their accomplishments,i
Members of my local union located in Michigan spent months working on the TransAlaska pipeline which covers 800 miles and carries oil from the North Slope of Alaska to Valdez Alaska,r
We talked about earlier and some of my colleagues talked about the carbon sequestration and how it is notthe technology is not there at this point in time,r
There are a lot of options available to us in the short and long term to produce hydrogen from a variety of different sources and thats one of its attractions,r
Do we have any planes that can fly on electricity plugin hybrid technology,i
And what we need to do is focus on how can we most efficiently reduce consumption and help reduce those overall energy costs,r
For illustrative purposes 43 quads is equivalent tobullet Over 20 million short tons of coal or enough coal to fill a coal train of railroad cars almost 2000 miles longbullet 418 billion cubic feet of natural gasbullet Almost 35 billion gallons of gasoline or more than 10 days of US gasoline consumptionbullet Almost 10 hours of the entire worlds energy use based on consumption levels in 1996bullet Nearly half of the approximate annual primary consumption of any one of the following states Arizona Arkansas Colorado Iowa Kansas Mississippi or Oregon based on consumption levels in 1996 This 43 quads represents a 39 total annual savings in cooling and a 19 savings in heating or a total heat and cooling savings of approximately 25 billion per year by 2010 given an adoption baseline of 1996,r
He said in his oil statement and again just now that somehow companyan individual company would have to go out and assess the exposure not only to their use of the chemical but to everybody else on the market,r
Again I have those plants I have coal plants but I also have refineries and chemical plants that have another issue,r
For instance over the last several years FERC issued two landmark orders facilitating energy storage and aggregated distributor energy resources participation in our organized wholesale markets,r
Does anybody believe that the coal industry should have the right to put unlimited amounts of carbon dioxide at zero cost into the atmosphere,r
It is one of those days as I said there is a hearing going on on the third floor and we have got about three hearings going in the Energy and Commerce Committee,i
Secretary Leavitt has made a personal investment and focus of energy on rebuilding of the Louisiana health care system supported by continuous technical expertise offered by CMS and senior officials throughout HHS,i
I reckon 1969 but we were without power and we are about 120 miles from the coast and we were without power about 20 days 19 20 days and at that time some of the water systems had started putting in generators very few but some had and you know welike I said in the testimony you can make it without power for a while rig up your generator to get the TV on or something but without water you cant make it and we immediately called our circuit riders,i
Secretary Moniz I want to talk to you specifically about access and equity in the energy transition,r
Through the Recovery Act we are making hundred million dollar grants in grant funds available to help the transit industry to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions for bus rail cars and other transit equipment,r
As a result diesel vehicles will achieve gasolinelike emissions levels,r
And we also operate the Nations most active LNG important terminal at Cove Point Maryland,r
While the blackout was a singular unprecedented event the fact remains that our national electric transmission system needs significant improvement and that we need to continue our efforts to enhance system reliability by expanding and improving the transmission system capabilities and interconnections,i
We cannot simply solve this crisis without focusing increasing our energy efficiency,r
The company also engages in new hydropower development through the building of new plants at existing dams,r
The money basically comes from private investors in Kyoto party nations like in Europe who choose to get some of their emissions credits through the clean development mechanism by investing in countries like China or India or African countries or developing countries around the world,r
Offering alternatives that must be included by the Secretary is an unnecessary infringement on the agencys authority and expertise but granting this preferential treatment to hydropower interests is patently unjust unfair and inconsistent with every other element of the Federal Power Act,r
Excavation damage is the leading cause of natural gas distribution pipeline incidents,r
And at that time and today state regulators agree that users of electricity from nuclear power plants should pay for the Federal nuclear waste management and disposal program,r
The NPCC system appears to have remained stable during this initial power surge,i
Well I am just in the research and analysis business but I would thinkand my friends in the industry can speak perhaps better but I think the biggest concern or two really one would be that the government is going to stand in the way of infrastructure projects that are needed to get investment in domestic oil and gas production and the second would be uncertainty about regulation of hydraulic fracturing going forward,r
The fact remains it was under Secretary Salazar that BPs initial exploration plan was reviewed and approved by the Minerals Management Service,r
And with Canadas vast proven oil reserves the prospect of North American energy independence is no longer political rhetoric but a promising reality,r
The Commission has jurisdiction over sales for resale of electric energy and transmission service provided by public utilities in interstate commerce,i
These include Adding new audit programs Creating guidelines for disclosure of reliability violations Strengthening existing reliability standards and enhancing compliance with reliability rules Improving operator training and Enhancing vegetation management practices around power lines,i
The President proposed a clean energy standard to increase the amount of energy we get from renewable sources of energy as well as from nuclear and advanced natural gas plants similar to what Mr Barton proposed from the last Congress,r
WANO is organized through regional centers and includes every operating nuclear electric plant in the world,r
Energy is the issue and it is one we need to deal with thoughtfully carefully deliberately through the legislative process,r
Whether surface temperatures will increase due to radiativelyactive emissions is not clear,r
I think what the President is most concerned about is that he would like to move the energy agenda forward,r
Todays hearing is surfacing some concerns about the power platforms have to editorialize the things internet users read and say but at the same time the FCC is considering wholesale elimination of rules that prevent broadband providers from doing that,i
We may even get some pleasant surprises such as we recently experienced with the shale gas revolution,r
Privately shipped items are safely regulated and federally overseen by both the US Department of Transportation and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC,i
It is a lesson for all of us as we consider the location of new LNG terminals as we become more dependent on natural gas,r
In this case industry recommended that to improve the NSR program we should allow owners of a facility to avoid the requirements of the NSR program if they improve facility energy efficiency or if they invest in a project for pollution prevention or pollution control simply on those bases,r
More recently while on the US Air Force Headquarters Staff I participated in developing and managing the response to the real world cyber attacks against the Department of Defense information infrastructure that came to be known as Solar Sunrise and Moonlight Maze,r
The budget proposal also makes several misguided changes to the structure of the power marketing administrations PMAs,i
For example if the fuel efficiency of our personal vehicle fleet was 42 miles per gallon today rather than 21 miles per gallon US oil demand would be lower by 4 million barrels per day oil markets would have spare capacity and the impact of any gasoline price spike would be far smaller,r
The Bipartisan Policy Centers June 2011 analysis of the rules also found that scenarios in which electric system reliability is broadly affected are unlikely to occur,i
There are tremendous opportunities for further job growth in the clean energy sector but to harness that potential we need to continue to evaluate and recalibrate Federal policies,r
If they made use of the technology that the power industry was used to which was pointtopoint secured connections or in fact the same techniques that existed in the phone industry there wouldnt be an issue,i
Id like to talk about one thing that largely did work and thats nuclear energy,r
Independent producers develop 90 percent of domestic wells and produce 85 percent of domestic natural gas,r
In conclusion I would say new nuclear power construction is prohibitively expensive renewable power is variable and not yet scalable and coalfired power plants are under constant attack from the EPA,r
My testimony today will provide a brief overview of the hydropower licensing program and some of the challenges it faces,r
The Charlotte ordinance requires a carbon monoxide alarm in every dwelling unit in the county,i
We have seen cases in Pavilion Wyoming and in Dimock Pennsylvania where the EPA has also accused oil and gas operators of groundwater contamination from fracking without sufficient evidence to justify those accusations,r
I remember this from a former colleague who was a Democratic insurance commissioner and saying that one of the problems that they ran into is they are running into things like when you have overseas employees and you provide them medical care if you want to send somebody to be an oil worker in Nigeria or something you know you are not only going to have to pay them well but you are going to have to make surethey are going to be worried about well hey you are sending me off to work on an oil platform in some Third World country what happens if something happens to me medically,i
And the bulkpower system includes facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electric energy transmission network,i
From a consumers point of view the Nation will be better off if we have a wide range of generation options and let the market work out the most cost effective solution to supplying our energy needs over time,r
If you export natural gas you factor into that equation the effect on US consumers and whether it is in the best interest of the United States,r
So this slide shows how you would replace one nuclear reactor that is 1154 megawatts with wind,r
As a sector we use 40 quads of energy and this has basically not changed in 40 years,i
Electric Divestiture in California,i
The changes would inappropriately expand FERCs natural gas authority attempt to undermine States rights and undermine the important role that other Federal and State agencies play in protecting natural resources for the public,r
Mr Wood you had power,i
All of the research that we have done points toward the need for a full portfolio generation options which includes the need for all forms of thermal generation including nuclear and coal,r
About 20 some percent and yet their carbon footprint is how much more for that production,r
As a physician and someone who represents constituents who have experience too many environmental injustices I am committed to working with members of this committee to create a cleaner and healthier environment for all,r
And you will catch some really good fish and some of the best eating you are going to find right there next to the oil rig,r
One way that I believe the commission can help to ensure reliability is through open communication and a strong working relationship with the EPA the Department of Energy the States and NARUC the North American Electric Reliability Corporation or NERC regional transmission organizations independent system operators and industry,r
At the risk of going a little bit off topic for what this panel was asked to talk about which was lowcarbon electricity and carbon capture and storage and renewables I wanted to at least frame the issue as also associated with the renewable fuel standard that was passed by this Congress previously,r
Today we are examining a law the Renewable Fuel Standard or RFS that is driving development of those new lowcarbon renewable fuels,r
What is the retail cost of your constituents for electricity in Washington,i
But we are also concerned that this power grab will do irreparable harm to the FCC as an institution and to the role of Congress as elected representatives of the people to determine the law of the land,i
This need not be limited to natural gas or other energy products,r
We have partnerships throughout the United States and with universities with national labs with all kinds of differentand other companies as well looking at everything from hydrogen to of course batteries and electrification of the vehicles and what is happening with compact natural gas and everything else,r
And either the oil itself or something in it is whats likely causing this outbreak,r
As Member of Congress from East Harris County and Houston Texas I have just literally hundreds of people who work offshore offshore Texas offshore literally all over the world and along with our infrastructure we still produce oil and natural gas in a very urbansuburban area but we also have refineries and chemical plants who need that product that is being produced,r
We simply cannot support eliminating the RFS program as the draft envisions without a much stronger signal to the market that ethanols role in our fuel supply will continue to grow,r
State regulators do not care if power plants get built only that the standards are followed,i
DOEs newly created Office of Cybersecurity Energy Security and Emergency Response leads these efforts,i
Since the drafts release the Environmental Protection Agency has issued a finding that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare,r
Can you elaborate why this makes such a difference for your members in providing greater certainty to prospective purchasers for redevelopment of petroleum contaminated brownfield sites that are cleaned up under a State program,r
This subcommittee this subcommittee should work together to prioritize the reliability of our power sector,i
The technology allows older coal plants to be retrofitted to burn cleaner eliminating the hassle of permitting a new power plant,r
Accordingly I request that the Agency work with Congress particularly Chairman Shimkus Mr Welch and me as we try to develop interim and longterm solutions fuel solutions that are good for the environment and good for auto mileage good for the American consumers good for the agricultural and ethanol interest and really good for all impacted stakeholders,r
The proposal would require all generators public utilities and power marketers to file electronically with the Commission and post on the Internet an index of customers with a summary of the contractual terms and conditions for marketbased power sales costbased power sales and transmission service,i
In recent years we have seen the impact of relying almost exclusively on natural gas based plants for new generation tight gas supply higher prices and backlogged projects for natural gas based plants,r
While the nodrive program did not produce the desired results the cleaner burning gasoline did,r
We will invest in medical research and clean energy technology,r
In the first hearing this subcommittee had this Congress my constituent the manager of a local rural electric cooperativethat is a notforprofit entity for those who are in the businessand a former environmental officer at the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency testified that doing so would increase utility rates for again a notforprofit electricity company by 25 percent,r
It is the utilities driving renewable growth and many other independent power producers driving renewable growth and we can take advantage of those independent power producers through very competitive RFPs and PPAs and certainly with our own facilities,r
But you continue to hide evaporative emissions by even using tailpipe emissions in my opinion,r
Towns which adds some common sense to a currently onerous relicensing process for nonfor Federal hydro projects,r
For these technologies air pollutant emissions will be associated only with the transport of the hydrogen to the point of use,r
Secretary Hogan in 2007 Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act,r
But the good news here is that the shortterm energy markets appeared to adjust rather quickly to the collapse of the largest energy trading company in the world,r
I mean that is why we want gasoline or diesel or biofuels or something,r
I think the natural markets that have formed that have some reasonable transmission capability within that region so you can move significant amounts of power within that region is a good start,i
And I visited Oregon Techs oneofakind geothermal plant in August and saw firsthand how they are taking advantage of great renewable resources in the Klamath Basin,r
what is your electricity analyst view this concept of economic dispatch where the generation that is the most economic and the least cost to develop gets some sort of a priority to be used first before you go to the less economically which tends to be the older plants that have been in thebasically in the baseload for a number of years,i
Last year the House included a provision in its energy bill requiring a Federal study into this boutique motor fuel issue,r
We strongly support the need for a comprehensive energy policy that focuses on adequate supply sources to aid strategic industries such as ours,r
Now sir since coming to the EPA I would like to ask you have you met with the American Petroleum Institute,r
Unfortunately due to nonmarket governmental forces giving preferential treatment to certain renewables two of these plants Byron and Dresden are now slated for closure,r
that material out to do exactly what Canada is doing to do exactly what needs to happen on the FremontWinema National Forests where you have more than 200000 acres of federal forestland that is exactly that way buginfested lodge pole pine when that material comes out why in the Devil do we say it is not renewable and cant be turned into pucks like this to help reduce carbon from coal,r
And if I can share more expertise that we have in Texas and the south related to wildfire hazardous fuel reduction and prescribed burning,r
Second did the Department of Energy sufficiently monitor the financial status of Solyndra after loan disbursements began particularly as the market forces seemed to be against them,r
PSEG our company our company is already beginning to invest heavily in alternative energy,r
As a consequence of the RFS we are now just 45 percent dependent on foreign oil for our liquid transportation fuels,r
Because the States want to be able to enforce requirements on others where they dont have control in their own jurisdiction to make sure that their neighboring States or regions are reducing the emissions,r
The Presidents own energy secretary the Presidents own energy secretary says Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,r
MERGERSCONVERGENCE MERGERS PUHCA restricts consolidations between electric and gas utilities operating in the same market again the SEC has been lax in enforcing this restriction,r
And in fact even as we speak here this afternoon officials in Louisiana are still waitingstill waiting for the Federal Government to provide millions of feet in boom to approve an emergency permit to fullynot partiallyimplement their plan to dredge and build a new barrier island to prevent even more oil from reaching their marshes and wetlands,r
Every time DOE issues a new rule it issues a press release estimating the rules benefit in cost savings for consumers and energy savings for the Nation based on theoretical models,r
No matter what decision we make on Yucca Mountain we still have a nuclear waste disposal issue,r
This will result in higherthannormal gas commodity prices even if the winter is relatively mild,r
Again we dont have a tax imposed on a person who buys a gas guzzling SUV but we have a gas guzzler tax that we impose on an automobile,r
It also provides for the issuance of orders to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities to protect the bulk power system from cyber attacks,i
For example todays efficiency standards for medium and heavyduty trucks are reducing emissions from those vehicles,r
Instead we develop runoftheriver hydro a smallscale hydro wind and wood waste power and they produced three times as many jobs,r
Environmental concerns are extremely important because energy production and consumption involve major externalitiescosts that are not easily reflected in market transactions,r
It is affecting a lot of other industries that depend on natural gas as either a raw material or as a fuel,r
I would also like to remind everyone that this is a pilot project a 2year pilot project which I think will give the Department of Energy adequate time to assess the situation and it certainly would be of benefit to our country,r
The commissions inability to come together on a unified response during the height of the Western energy crisis in 2000 caused consumers to pay significantly more for electricity and natural gas than they should have,i
Our agreement builds on XTOs nearly quarter century of success in developing affordable reliable cleanerburning US unconventional natural gas supplies for use by Americans,r
We had better find a way to use coal in a clean manner,r
This KXL scheme is equivalent to a 4 billionayear tax on the oil we are already getting from Canada with all the money going from American wallets and pocketbooks to oil companies,r
The Johnson Johnson 7 Minute Wellness for Expecting and New Moms App is a sciencebased wellness resource designed to help new moms manage and expand their energy during pregnancy and after giving birth,i
The electric power sector will continue to strive to meet those expectations through a multilayered strategy to invest in smart energy infrastructure continuous enhancement of our industryGovernment partnership and the grit of the amazing men and women who make the energy grid work dayin and dayout,i
Second my second point the rising US gasoline prices has come at a time of soaring US gasoline production,r
Significant pillars of our program are deployment of nonCOINF2INF sources of generation like renewables and nuclear reduced COINF2INF emissions through efficiency and the COINF2INF capture from fossil fuels,r
The Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality chairs the Interagency Task Force whose membership includes representatives from the Departments of Agriculture Commerce Defense Energy the Interior and Transportation the Environmental Protection Agency the Federal Regulatory Commission and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation,i
And this is a key moment for the committee to play a role in addressing climate change and this bill does make several key investments for our energy future although I am willing to entertain more possibilities,r
Anticipating efforts in the first half of 2006 particularly in the first quarter and moderating energy prices will create a seesaw effect for the US economy and manufacturing,r
I think the increased production has been very good for our economy but my concern is that the technology that we need to keep production cleanby clean I mean carbon greenhouse gas emissions from production greenhouse gas emissions in transportationthat they are not there to keep up with the demand that would increase if we lifted the export ban,r
We had great debate over whether this administration the Obama administration is hostile to energy production on land offshore and on Federal lands etc and the argument that that is the case is not supported by the facts,r
Commander Lippold are you concerned that this legislation essentially permanently lifts the ban even though we may start to see a decrease in oil production as early as the 2020s,r
Nuclear science and technologies take advantage of radiation and nuclear properties of the atom to perform many useful activities such as improving food safety protecting our homeland and providing for precise industrial production,i
We know from past statistics that the solar industry is in the top 10 growing industries in our country,r
And are you aware of the significant concerns because I know I have heard a lot about it with the pending regulations and their impact on the affordability of wood wood heating,r
Timely advance in clean coal technology will require significant cost share funding for research and development projects and demonstrations of emerging technology and tax incentives to reduce the risks and encourage early development and refinement of the new technologies,r
There is a great controversy right now Congressman over the Environmental Protection Agencys proposed rules for particulate emissions from coal plants and also greenhouse gas emissions,r
The Department of Energys 32 billion budget proposal serves as a reminder of the broad range of defense science energy and environmental activities that your agency pursues to perform its really important critical I would say national and energy security missions,r
I would imagine just engaging in the economywide outcome with carbon pricing Ms Palmer,r
I want to hear whats fair when you shut down a coalfired power plant and it destroys the fabric the economic basis to run a school system in a county when millions of dollars are lost,r
He has added substantially to the states ability to deal with our current energy situation,r
Therefore new highvoltage transmission lines must be built in order to get electrical power to the stations,i
Hydro provides six to seven percent of all electricity generation and nearly half of all renewable generation making hydro the largest provider of renewable electricity,r
Michael C Burgess Congress established the Corporate Average Fuel Economy program in 1975 to improve vehicle fuel economy reduce oil consumption and secure the Nations energy independence,r
Last fall we published a report Biofuels Issues and Trendsit is attached to my testimonyto provide an overview of the dynamics of production consumption trade in ethanol biodiesel and cellulosic fuels,r
Pike is a participating member of a group called the Center for Energy Workforce Development,i
Two years later in 2015 the integrated systems and part of the Western Area Power Administration in the upper Midwest joined SPP marking the first time a Federal power marketing administration chose to join the market,i
It is the agency that makes sure your coffee maker does not burn down your house your baby does not die from a defective crib your power drill doesnt electrocute you your hot water heater does not poison you your childs toy is not made of lead et cetera and these are all real examples of defective products that have been recalled and they demonstrate the important role the Commission should play in protecting consumers,i
It is about the lack of restraint and the pricing power that the pharma industry has that is resulting in immense heartache for families and you can create a lifeextending painrelieving drug,i
Joe Barton Chairman Committee on Energy and Commerce Thank you Mr Chairman for holding this hearing to determine the current status of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline,r
Muir is concerned only about carbon,r
Now let me share some of our observations about the futures markets specifically for heating oil and natural gas,r
Two air pollution emissions were reduced,i
EPAs greenhouse gas rule will impose a de facto ban on construction of new coal,r
We greatly appreciate the bipartisan support for coal in the Committee as reflected in both the Housepassed version of HR,r
Of course some might argue that there is big difference between running a coaltochemicals manufacturing facility and a coaltoelectricity power plant,r
The only real downside to nuclear energy is figuring out what to do with the waste,r
I mean it seemed to me we ran a 2 to 3 natural gas for a long time,r
Let me ask you point blank does it make sense for us to have a regulatory structure where it costs almost four times as much to license a hydropower plant as it costs to license a new natural gasfired plant,r
And the clean energy sector employed roughly three times more workers than the fossil fuel sector in 2019,r
Well from a fire science perspective you always have to remember you have to have drying of the fuels to a point where they can be ignited and sustain ignition and you have to have ignition,i
If you want to expand on that and also doesnt a twotier system basically already exist since all clean resources other than nuclear have outofmarket payment subsidies and everything that impact their bid price,r
You are quoting an unnamed energy publication,r
Now were focusing on climate tact and climate energy,r
So now that youre on the job I wanted to ask you specifically do you believe that greenhouse gas emissions endanger the public health,r
bullet Allowing economies of scale in manufacturing installation operation and maintenance of renewable energy facilities,r
In the energy study that was conducted last summer after the price spikes like we saw in California they found that a 25 percent reduction in their usage at peak times would have saved Californians 700 million last summer,r
Yes it is in my opinion highly likely that any living thing that is exposed to high enough concentrations obviously if it is oil and dispersant mixtures are very likely to be poisoned,r
We do need to streamline the regulatory process for liquefied LNG exports,r
A more predictable rational and flexible air quality permit process including reforms to newsource review will allow for more investment in domestic facilities including carbon capture and a stronger domestic manufacturing base instead of production in other countries who dont share our countrys commitment to stewardship,r
And as a municipal utility CPS Energy belongs to a class of utilities termed public power utilities,i
Energy demand growth over the past 20 years has been met by the steady exploitation of the large investments made during the last energy boom period in the 1970s,r
Do you agree or disagree that it is too late to prevent the carbon dioxide emissions from increasing to 450,r
This program would establish a unique partnership between government and industry to help ensure we meet midterm gas demand through the development of technically challenged but potentially prolific provinces,r
And we are not alone electric utilities in the Northeast and the Southeast have also spent countless hours and invested millions of dollars in efforts to form their own RTOs,i
On the other hand keeping the focus on energy efficiency is not easy when energy prices are low,r
Putting the current situation in a broader more positive perspective however the US has some of the cleanest and least costly fuels in the world,r
Congressman to me the answer to your questions depends on what your view of future fossil fuel prices are,r
And on the battery side it is really beautiful because we are very fuel agnostic,r
It has been 30 years since Congress designated Nevadas Yucca Mountain as a secure site for our Nations nuclear wastewater,r
This simply reflects the large amount of capital necessary to find refine and distribute petroleum products,r
That is the entirety of all of our liabilities that include all of our nuclear ships and the eventual cleanup for those and a variety of other items,i
This bipartisan effort underscores one of the key goals of the Energy and Commerce Committee helping American entrepreneurs and established businesses expand to create jobs for American workers and help improve the lives of consumers,i
Second I do think that green coal and carbon sequestration is the most important single breakthrough we could make because the objective fact is China is adding one coalburning plant a week,r
But having more and more acres burn without addressing the underlying causes will only make our air quality and greenhouse gas pollution issues that much worse,i
However the point of both the Minorities in Energy Initiative as well as my workforce bill is that it really shouldnt matter who is in the White House that the agency DOE has the affirmative responsibility to work on increasing opportunities for all,r
Mr Robo you mentioned that you are managing the largest solar bank in the world is that right,r
bullet Efficiency Government policies should encourage the efficient use of energy by insuring a level playing field for competing sources of energy,r
The goals are to reduce foreign oil imports and improve air qualitynot subsidize American industry,r
We employ really goodpaying jobs and it is not quite clear to us whether we are qualified under that but certainly we would think we should be because as a result right now there is about 6500000 barrels of oil of refining capacity that is being built outside of our borders much of which is being targeted to come into this country so if we dont have some similar protections and some guidelines we are concerned about leakage and ultimately increasing imports at the expense of our domestic production,r
And a lot of it had to do with deregulating our domestic environment and making a whole suite of challenges and deciding that we were going to commit to this internationally connected and efficient market for oil and gas and things like that,r
In that same hearing Ms Angielski we heard testimony that fossil energy will remain a major part of the energy mix in growing nations like India Vietnam Colombia South Africa because the sources are domestic abundant and affordable,r
Although I recognize the role that nuclear power plays in our Nations longterm energy strategy and the need to properly store expired nuclear fuel I remain strongly opposed to any effort to reinstate Yucca Mountain,r
The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours,i
As potential vulnerabilities emerge in the Nations utility distribution infrastructure ensuring reliable sources of energy for our installations has become increasingly challenging,r
And the second is that Congress has power to substantially correct it if it so chooses,i
So if that were correct and I dont disagree with you on that coming from a coal State but if that is correct then why are we having policy that is moving us in that direction,r
Likewise in Puerto Rico Hurricanes Irma and Maria uncovered the intensified issues associated with aging and inefficient energy infrastructure contaminated sites that are rapidly multiplying landfills that are already overflowing and possibly the most contaminated drinking water supply in the United States,r
Our investments are designed to deliver and promote reliable marketavailable policies practices and life cycle cost effective technologies that will permanently reduce a trajectory of US energy demand growth and carbon footprint of the built environment while maintaining strong economic growth,r
But I think you would agree with me that it has been in about the last 10 years or so that it has been used a lot more than it had been because of the necessity of getting some difficult natural gas out of the ground,r
Municipal utilities in my Tennessee district saw the cost of natural gas soar to near 10 per million Btus on the spot market over the winter,r

The Presidents proposal removes this requirement allowing plants with no pollution controls at all to keep on polluting,r
The C2P2 encourages generators and users of coal combustion products to increase the use of coal ash in cement and other construction products,r
Congressman Latta I have also negotiated retransmission consent contracts and I would tell you that in the case of Suddenlink they were almost always successfully negotiated because we simply didnt have any power at the table to do anything other than accept the deal we were given,i
We have separately established methodology for coal ash users to analyze their products and we have in fact applied that methodology to demonstrate that in concrete and wallboardthat we have confirmed its continued use,i
However it is crucial that there is parity among incentives such that they can be enjoyed by public power and investor owned utilities alike,i
In addition the quadrennial energy review will provide an opportunity to look at obstacles to building gathering lines that would allow you to capture natural gas,r
But I worry that you will labor mightily and give forth with a capandtrade that will produce a carbon price that is too low to affect physical change,r
At the same time Keystone will increase our Nations longterm security by accessing oil from our friendly neighbors to the north from Canada,r
But it still leaves the rest of the number which is the 60 or 70 percent which has come from or will have to come from hydrocarbons using advanced technologies,r
Ultimately Congressman if the Department of Homeland Security felt that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission hadnt moved either quickly enough or effectively enough visavis the threat you are talking about one would hope that the new Cabinet Secretary in conjunction with the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission can resolve that,r
The reference case includes the effects of several policies aimed at increasing energy efficiency in both enduse technologies and supply technologies including minimum efficiency standards and voluntary energy savings programs,r
NEPOOLs old financial assurance policies allowed the organization to rescind membership in the Pool but did not allow NEPOOL to cut off a company from trading in the energy markets in response to a situation like that posed by Enron,i
However it is doubtful that hydrogen demand will increase so rapidly as to adversely affect the supply of natural gas,r
Secondly the volume of trading in the carbon market will be at least 300 times greater than the SO2 market,r
Im surprised Mr Garman didnt sort of agree with what I told him about petroleum,r
Activated carbon is a specially prepared product of coal or biomass that is able to adsorb many chemicals from gases or liquids,r
My home State of New Jersey has a draft energy master plan that calls for the electrifying the building sector by 2050 and reducing the reliance on natural gas for heating homes and buildings,r
For example advanced nuclear technologies might be one thing that you could put into repower an existing fossil generating plant like that,r
Shell was one of the first integrated oil companies to acknowledge the impacts of human activity on the climate and we believe now is the time to act,r
Either Tippy dam in Michigan or the Bull Shoals dam and hydro project in Arkansas on the White River,r
But it is now 2015 and global and domestic oil markets have changed significantly we would all recognize that and SPRO needs to be modernized,r
While I have said on several occasions that the Yucca Mountain project merits independent and objective oversight I am also concerned that this Subcommittees myopic focus on Yucca Mountain has diverted its attention from other pressing nuclear safety issues,r
When EPA announced plans to control benzene emissions from chemical production plants you know remember that industry claimed pollution controls would cost over 350000 per plant but instead technological innovation led to replacement of benzene with other chemicals and the compliance costs turned out to be zero,i
Then the President issued two executive orders intended to increase energy production,r
US dependence on imported oil has fallen since the RFS was enacted from 60 percent in 2005 to 40 percent today,r
OK Andso just why is it important to examine that bulk power system reliability through the lens of recent extreme weather events and not just the Texas power failure,i
Are you both familiar with the EPAs efforts and have you been invited at all to participate in their process of establishing a registry and if so could you elaborate on some of the suggestions that you have made to design a registry and recognizing of course that we already are doing emissions registry in the electrical sector,i
In short we cannot afford to have this kind of failure on our electric system happen again,i
OK Now those greenhouse gas emissions are not only CO2,r
Should this final FIP result in closure of the San Juan plant and mine hundreds of jobs will be lost not only in the coal and power industry on the Nation but in the service support industry and public sector as well,r
I think all of us are committed to trying to find out what did take place and put the steps in place that are necessary to make this a safersafer and sounder future for us in terms of oil and gas exploration,r
This added step of accountability is crucial to keep an account of delays and avoid the increasing backlog of hydropower relicensing,r
On September 21st EPA expanded this effort in order to minimize potential fuel supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Rita,r
Too often lowincome older persons are faced with the choice of risking their health and comfort by cutting back on energy expenditures or reducing spending for other basic necessities,r
Well the World Resources Institute doesnt take a particular position on this specific issue but certainly by reducing these upstream methane emissions we could ensure that natural gas is lowercarbonemittingor lowergreenhousegasemitting than coal or oil when oil and diesel fuel is used for transportation,r
One of the projects that we delivered at the beginning of last year to San Diego Gas and Electric the speed at which the project was actually delivered to San Diego Gas and Electric was about 6 to 8 months,i
We in California introduced building standards and appliance standards and conservation programs for the utilities to beat the standards and we have kept electricity use constant per person for 30 years now even though everything is bigger and there are more loads and Gross Domestic Product per disposable income went up 80 percent we managed to keep electricity use constant with better refrigerators better air conditioners better buildings,i
Massachusettss long and distinguished record investing in energy efficiency is delivering great results,r
This regulation will not only stifle innovation but inject uncertainty into the manufacturing sector while creating less energyefficient products and higher energy prices for consumers,i

But in fact the Department of Energy Clean Energy Future study I mentioned above uses the same model run by EIA and reaches dramatically different conclusions,r
The Chair would recognize the ranking member of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Mr Boucher of Virginia,r
Collectively NACS and SIGMA members sell more than 75 percent of the gasoline and diesel fuel purchased by American consumers each year,r
Well just to add on that most of the nuclear plant sites in the country have had to add additional storage capacity either in the form of expanding the pools themselves or how to manage the pools or putting them in what is known as dry cask storage,r
And subsequently the utility which was buying the energy for the consumers in primarily the spot market didnt know what had been going on subsequently said they had been buying from only 2 or 3 sellers at times and locations in the city,i
The amount of gasoline that can be supplied to a particular region may be inflexible in the short run because of various limitations on refining and transportation capabilities or product requirements unique to that region,r
For example should we use natural gas directly for transport or convert it to hydrogen first,r
The Xcel and Mirant traders discussed schemes to schedule nonexistent power use and to take advantage of congestion payments on Californias overburdened electric grid,i
However we remain at a regional disadvantage for access to much of the existing renewable energy options,r
So therefore the regional power market does not see the price signal that RGGI is intended to deliver,i
First the nuclear crisis in Japan is now in its fourth week with no end in sight,r
Now we have lowcost fuel,r

OTHER ISSUES Many other issues are under consideration with respect to a fuels title in an 2003 energy bill,r
Once there is a truly competitive retail market and QFs can buy backup power in the open market then and only then will the backup power guarantee no longer be essential to existing and future CHP power generators,i
Encouraging the broadest range of fuel technologies is critical to the type of transformational change necessary to improve our Nations energy security,r
And then finally we should encompass principles that do not harm American energy workers that help to enhance their training and capacity to increase their economic success and security,r
Just 10 years ago most ethanol plants capacity was 10 to 15 million gallons per year,r
Some products may not be available in your area for example but I am not sure of how a consumer would know which zone they are in as well as what the energy prices are in that part of the country,r
As an integral part of their transmission systems interstate natural gas pipelines own and operate a majority of the natural gas storage capacity in the United States,r
There has been widespread media reports and even some comments by congressional leaders of gasoline price gouging by gasoline marketers in the wake of Katrina,r
This bill is a radical rewrite of the Clean Air Act that would block any real reductions in carbon pollution from coal plants and it ignores 40 years of experience,r
Its trading 30 percent of the West Texas Intermediate benchmark crude oil contract on United States terminals located in the United States and denominated in United States dollars,r
But what I am interested in is how we find that sweet spot where we can develop North American energy resources and effectively manage our carbon emissions simultaneously,r
Because electricity markets are connected by wires different pollution standards promote a survival of the filthiest market where the power plants that are the dirtiest run harder because they can slightly underbid cleaner generators,r
Were you involved in any communications with the White House to push the Department of Energy to speed this thing along,r
You know we have this theme about gaming the system and throughout Energy and Commerce has really been looking at this whole issue of drug pricing and trying to figure out why these prices are so high,i
OK And I also understand that there is a market issue in terms of how the New England plants buy their gas,r
The prepared statement of Stephen E Ewing follows Stephen E Ewing President Chief Operating Officer DTE Energy Gas on Behalf of the American Gas Association Thank you for the opportunity to testify before this Committee on behalf of the American Gas Association and the 56 million consumers served by its members,i
1 To ensure a common basis for comparison the capital costs of electric generating technologies are expressed in dollars per kilowatt of capacity,i
Therefore the agenda is one of purely decarbonization and climate change not really of energy security not really of air pollution because if it were about air pollution or just clean energy you would have uniform support for things like diverse nuclear power natural gas and so forth,r
In this case those factors are the consequences of a strike in Venezuela that crippled that countrys export capability for months weather much colder than normal in parts of the country where energy use is extremely sensitive to temperature and uncertainty over crude oil supply in the immediate future due to the international situation involving Iraq,r
Thus because implementation of RFG will produce more NOINFXINF emissions than Georgias lowsulfur gasoline RFG may actually produce higher ozone values and adversely impact public health,r

As a result of this proposal the power rates in many areas in Arkansas that have not benefited from the economic recovery would increase,i
In Brazil where a high percentage of ethanol fuels are sold consumers do indeed consider energy content pricing rather than simply buying the cheapest fuel,r
You probably should think about doing the same thing with our national model energy code the IECC,r
