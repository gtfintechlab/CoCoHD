223,First engage the consumer in reducing their own energy use and carbon footprint through the Energy Star Program,i
224,I know their program is what they are trying to develop there is also been using solar panels so they can go to areas without electricity and still be able to process water for families in that immediate area,r
225,As far as we can tell and we have tried to look at this at EIA we cant really see a big impact in the price of gasoline from what happened with RINs in the first quarter of this year,r
226,Second the National Nuclear Security Administrations direct Federal oversight was narrowly focused on specific performance measures called out in the contract rather than on overall effectiveness and the interface between different areas and I will say more about this in a moment,i
227,I believe that we should ask ourselves how Federal investment into clean energy can improve the lives of our constituents and our communities,r
228,The Electric Power Research Institute which is I believe an independent and objective research institution part of the electric power industry put on a forum in Washington where they brought all of the modelers who had actually produced analyses of the LiebermanWarner bill the Clean Air Task Force the Energy Information Administration the work that was sponsored by the National Association of Manufacturers Massachusetts Institute of Technology with their EPO model EPA and Charles River Associates,i
229,producing the same oil that then we would have to be paying more for because then it would be coming from another country,i
230,Last year US production increased over a million barrels a day and if we were to repeal the ban on crude oil exportsnow this is an opinion,r
231,What I wanted to say was that we looked at this and did some computations in the study that we did at NERA and what we found is that using an oil export ban to try to limit field emissions or greenhouse gas emissions associated with fuel consumption is about the worst possible climate policy you could think of,r
232,Yes we share a commitment with Canada to work towards energy security,i
233,I think it is possible on a bipartisan basis to do things that actually further the science further the research into carbon capture and conversion accelerate the use of existing technologies like nuclear power some of the alternative energy sources that we know are zero emissions wind power new hydropower things like that,r
234,I mean I dont want to be an expert in gas cans to be able to use that product,i
235,Is that enough reliance or should we do modeling before we resume exploration and drilling in the Gulf of Mexico,r
236,We are now in the midst of preparations for an important transitionfrom the prelicensing role defined for NRC in statute to the role of regulator and licensing authorityif a decision is made to authorize the Department of Energy DOE to submit a license application for Yucca Mountain,i
237,The commission has a stake in the national energy policy and has identified areas where new legislation would be helpful,i
238,In addition TIGR has also sequenced a wide range of important environmental microbessome of which live in extreme environments but may be critically important to the health of the planetand that carry out a variety of interesting metabolic reactions including degradation of cellulose and other organic matter precipitation of heavy metals such as uranium from solution and production of methane and hydrogen as potential new sources of fuel,r
239,We regularly review our program to identify ways to improve it and in just the last 2 years we reduced the threshold for positive tests for testosterone greatly increased our use of highly sensitive carbon isotope ratio testing increased inseason random testing by 40 percent increased the penalty for repeat violators added many new substances to our prohibited list and tripled the number of times a player may be tested in the offseason,i
240,This one is from TXU Energy down in Texas,i
241,I think that is an incredibly positive development and in fact the predictions of all the oil growth that Raymond James and Citigroup have made all assume that those new rules are going to be implemented yet we are going to have this explosion in oil production yet with the production of which offshore is going to be much safer for the workers and for the environment,r
242,Fortunately I understand that FERC operations have returned to near normal having cleared much of that backlog allowing the commission to turn its attention towards a host of issues ranging from controversial changes to the RTO capacity markets to how new energy infrastructure projects should be evaluated under FERCs certificate policy,i
243,We recently canceled a clean coal boiler project that is a good example of this potential outcome,r
244,You heard about the domestic manufacturing of wind turbine components that has also increased dramatically over the last 5 years as the renewable standards have ramped up,r
245,The consensus decision making rule Prior witnesses at these hearings have suggested that the consensus requirement of the 661 Committee made it difficult to establish effective oversight of the Oil for Food program,r
246,It can also help ensure that our communities are more resilient to the impacts of climate change as you know well in your State from power outages to flooding and storm surges,i
247,Our environment and our economy depend on congressional action to confront the threat of climate change and secure our energy independence,i
248,There is a great deal of uncertainty about the size and availability of crude oil resources particularly conventional resources the adequacy of investment capital and geopolitical trends,r
249,We have the chance to turn a major liability into a valuable commodity through which the department can generate new revenue to help expand their mission as we move towards energy independence and combating global warming,i
250,And while it is so exciting to have vehicles that are keyless and others that turn off and on for energy efficiency and others that will be plugged in this committees work is going to have to continue to make sure that we are doing the things we do to keep people safe,i
251,I guess what I would conclude you said you would not put a roadblock up to exporting coal,r
252,For example for an average family driving 2500 miles a month a 1 gallon runup in gasoline prices as we have seen in recent weeks takes 120 out of their monthly budget if they are driving vehicles that average 21 miles per gallon but it would only take 60 out of their budget if those vehicles average 42 miles per gallon which is within our technical capability,r
253,This bill sets out a national strategy to assist US clean energy technology companies with export assistance to find new markets for their products and services and to better compete in the international marketplace,r
254,You noted at the outset of your tenure at the EPA that your goal was to refocus EPA on its intended mission return power to the states and create an environment where jobs can grow,i
255,So you do acknowledge that using a lot of fuel does in fact create jobs,r
256,Whereas much of the risk in developing the traditional telephony networks was shouldered long ago in a market where the incumbents had monopoly power the development and deployment of broadband presents an enormous and immediate financial risk for firms,i
257,To highlight a few first we should reestablish and expand Federal agency targets for annual improvements and energy efficiency renewable energy and other key metrics and make needed changes to unlock the use of contracting mechanisms that leverage private funds for public efficiency and renewable projects,r
258,But before March 1979 was the last instance where the NRC received an application for a new nuclear power generation plant,i
259,She says As a result of shortsighted energy policies poor longterm planning and extensive rolling blackouts in 2020 CAISO petitioned FERC to make changes to its tariff related to transmission priority through California,i
260,I share Mr Shimkuss concerns about the effect of carbon cap and trade on this economy,r
261,So here is this switch that when it is in one position for an emissions test it made a change in how this was operational so the emissions would be lower,i
262,Going further if we aggressively improve efficiency by four or five percentage points then emissions could fall by 250 metric tons about 13 percent of last years carbon dioxide emissions from coal power,r
263,Public power systems throughout the United States have seen direct economic benefits from deploying broadband networks,i
264,I want to thank all the witnesses for being here and look forward to hearing your testimony as this committee evaluates the state of our wholesale electricity markets and I yield back,i
265,Approximately 10 years ago Beaver County started to see the effects of the technological advancements that made developing the Marcellus Shale possible,r
266,Mr Reicher if we do nothing other than roll back EPAs modest steps to reduce carbon emissions are we at risk at losing the clean energy jobs race with China,r
267,So againit came up in the other hearing and I do feel obligated to point outthere is a limit to how much energy you can import if everyone is using their system to the maximum,i
268,Thus those tax policies stifled the industry at a time when US energy demand was increasing significantly,i
269,Our objectives area to exercise and perform the powers and duties assigned to the IMO under this Act the market rules and its licenceb enter into agreements with transmitters giving the IMO authority to direct the operations of their transmission systemsc direct the operations and maintain the reliability of the IMO controlled gridd establish and operate the IMOadministered marketse collect and provide to the public information relating to the current and future electricity needs of Ontario and the capacity of the integrated power system to meet those needsf participate in the development by any standards authority of standards and criteria relating to the reliability of transmissions systems andg work with responsible authorities outside Ontario to coordinate the IMOs activities with their activities,i
270,Likewise when insurance companies are able to pull their market power to negotiate lower rates there can be positive results,i
271,The US Senate has twice passed a RPS and the majority of Senators on the energy bill conference supported the Bingaman RPS amendment,i
272,Seeing the issues that we have had with our voluntary domestic carbon market I can only imagine how these issues will be compounded when the value of potential offsets increases and we are relying on verifying offsets in the developing world,i
273,In that case the question that I will find most important is Will moving to a highoctane fuel standard do a better job in incentivizing and creating market signals for advanced biofuels,r
274,When that merging occurs will we on the Energy and Commerce Committee be made aware of what that structure looks like and how the fund then subsequently is to be administered,i
275,1013 would create more red tape and delay and would severely reduce protections for rivers and fisheries impacted by hydroelectric generation,i
276,We need to stop fighting over a diminished pot of money and recognize that our national welfare demands that we enlarge the pot so that no deserving energy technology is starved out of federal RD funding,i
277,Is it fair to say that Order 1000 provides a structure for other regions of the country to likewise identify and build transmission infrastructure that is needed to bring new renewable resources online,r
278,A delay will also give time for utilities to avoid what appears to be an overreliance on natural gas,r
279,Integrity Management Rule for Natural Gas Transmission OPS issued the integrity management rule for natural gas transmission lines on December 12 2003,i
280,This group spent over two years evaluating and documenting best practices from across all types of energy pipeline systems,i
281,A 10 percent reduction in environmental management an 8 percent reduction in the Office of Science 86 percent reduction in energy efficiency and renewable energy,r
282,The principal environmental benefits associated with coal gasification as compared to coal combustion processes are in the short term significantly lower emissions of serious air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide NOINFXINF and I should say almost virtual removal of volatile mercury,r
283,So for instance one of my companies Sun Drop Fuels has adopted a different model so they went to Chesapeake a natural gas company because they are going to use natural gas as part of the feedstock in their plant,r
284,There is not existing biology there would be no reason to have organisms involved to do this and pump lots of hydrocarbons,i
285,Although more than half the increase in natural gas consumption between 2000 to 2020 is expected in the East the Westincluding Canadian imports and most of the Gulf Offshoreis expected to provide approximately 80 percent of the incremental lower 48 natural gas supply in the reference case,r
286,Nobody disagrees with the need for the additional power,i
287,But just kind of bottom line we know that for every fullservice hotel like a Marriott we send millions of dollars of buying power back into local communities through the salaries and supply chain,i
288,Chairman Meserve I have got a series of questions about the transportation of nuclear waste,i
289,As Ohioans discuss this issue across the state we hear one overriding concern maintaining our affordable reliable power is critical to both the pocketbooks of Ohioans and continued economic development within our state,i
290,The Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration are fully committed to the homeland security mission and the successful establishment of the Department of Homeland Security,i
291,In 2006 we actually voluntarily capped our own greenhouse gas emissions,r
292,Technology can also be a driver for increased energy efficiency and Reps McNerney Welch and Kinzinger have introduced bills that analyze and support new technologies in smart buildings and water systems,i
293,I look forward to working with you on these exciting new initiatives to take action on climate change and expand our clean energy economy,r
294,The markets are so tight though that if we can moderate demand a little bit our analysis using the same computer models that DOE uses indicates that with 4 to 5 percent energy savings we can reduce these prices over the next decade by 20 percent or more,i
295,TESTIMONY OF THOMAS N PYKE JR CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Mr Pyke,i
296,And that is the kind of dual standard that the Republicans want us to accept even as oil has dropped from 57 percent imported to 45 percent imported since Bush walked out the door in January,r
297,And what is the US consumption of gasoline per day,i
298,Also because Kansas allows local utilities to flow through the cost of gas to consumers the ratepayers experienced dramatic increases in the cost of natural gas during the winter seasons,r
299,Today we depend on these technologies for everything from social interaction to home security the operation of critical services like power plants and the electric grid,i
300,So I would just ask that you go and pursue the administration policies that are killing energy production and causing higher gas prices instead of going to Saudi Arabia,r
301,Senator Daschle has introduced S 670 which adopts an ethanol mandate similar to the approach to S 2962,r
302,The concern I have I have expressed it many times on the high cost of natural gas and not only for heating our homes or cooling our homes if you are in my area of the country but also for the feed stock for our petrochemical industry,r
303,Each day more exploration and development activity in the Gulf is lost,r
304,Sincerely Richard A Abdoo Chairman of the Board President and Chief Executive OfficerAttachment Electric Generation Tax IncentivesSeven Year Cost Recovery With regard to depreciation the recovery periods permitted under current law for assets used to produce and distribute electricity are much longer than the recovery periods allowed for other capital intensive industries,i
305,So that is why I am grateful to you Mr Chairman for crafting the Energy and Revenue Enrichment Act to give the Department of Energy the flexibility it needs to temporarily reenrich tails at Paducah and Portsmouth,i
306,Question 3 How does the new supply margin market power test in the Commissions order of November 20 differ from the established hubandspoke test for market power,i
307,As we develop a comprehensive national energy policy efficiency and conservation are definitely part of what needs to be a comprehensive plan that also needs to include the development of our own natural resources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,r
308,Time of use metering is a similar application of technology which will better help electric customers understand when they use electricity the price consequences thereof and ways to save money,i
309,Our notforprofit independent status precludes me from choosing between fuels,i
310,Considering the nations maximized operational capacity increased reliance on imported oil and strained refining infrastructure any complicating factors in the gasoline distribution chain refining outages or multiple smallmarket fuel formulations can easily impact overall supply and consumer costs,r
311,These plants have proven to be highly reliable in all weather conditions costeffective in operation and act as crucial anchors to the national electric grid,i
312,Public power also sells any excess power when available in the wholesale market,i
313,As our country pursues interim storage solutionsand ultimately a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuelit is critical that we ensure the funds necessary to safely transport and store this material are available,i
314,Our aim is to strengthen energy markets and encourage innovation throughout the electricity sector giving consumers more choice and greater control over their energy decisions while also benefiting the environment,r
315,My testimony aligns with the following points America is facing two national security threats one around climate change and the other around the US nuclear power enterprise,i
316,We need metals for our legacy energy businesses our carbonbased businesses oil gas coal whatever,i
317,As you know Mr Chairman there have been many developments in the Nations energy portfolio since FERC issued Order No,i
318,But in fact I think it has worked out very well in the electric sector in the sense that we have utilities all other extensions above power systems or at least meeting minimum standards and we saw a good example with Texas this past winter,i
319,Could you describe the goals of your partnership and also what you hope to learn through these field tests and can you give us a sense of when you think carbon sequestration technology could be sufficiently reliable for deployment and for something we can actually begin to rely upon as we structure legislation that in fact might require the capture and sequestration of carbon,i
320,Shifting gears I believe the Energy Star program is a nice complement to the mandatory federal energy efficiency standards for many energyusing products in that it helps consumers identify those models that go above and beyond the minimum standards,i
321,The depressing part of my introduction is I realize I have been at this for 3 decades as part of the House of Representatives staff during the oil embargoes and after I was with Mr Garvin in 1983 and 1984 in the Energy Department running conservation and renewable programs and have been a consumer advocate for the last 10 years,i
322,Other FreedomCAR challenges include technical market infrastructure and public policy hurdles before fuel cell vehicles are commercially available and DOEs vision of a petroleum free emission free transportation system is a reality,i
323,Coalfired electricity is only cheap if one ignores the health and economic costs,r
324,In this same vein expert witnesses are called before us today to discuss policies to deeply decarbonize our economy and strengthen our infrastructure against threats like climate change,i
325,Electric utilities also have a long history of providing mutual assistance and the same concept is being applied by the ESCC for mutual support in response to cyber incidents though challenges unique to cyber must be taken into account,i
326,But on the other hand those that want to have exploration we think that the country and the committee should stand behind those States if the prospects are indeed there,r
327,First the authority Congress set forth for setting efficiency standards the Energy Policy Conservation Act is 40 years old and has not been undated to reflect new technologies and economic realities,i
328,He is also board president of the Distributed Wind Energy Association and is testifying on behalf of the Distributed Wind Energy Association,i
329,I will simply say in closing Mr Chairman that one instance of which I am particularly aware the Department of Defense has worked closely with a company in Orange County California which I represent Liquid Metal Technologies to develop an alternative weapon an alternative to depleted uranium emissions that have proven toxic if not severely toxic,i
330,FERC grid operators State public utility commissions and power plants even progressive power companies are already planning for the changes that are under way,i
331,Are these coal refusetoenergy facilities typically located in a smaller community or a larger community,i
332,It is complete power,i
333,If not I would ask unanimous consent that wewhen we reconvene at 1030 that opening statementsthe only opening statements we will have will come from the chairman the ranking member of the full committee the chairman and the ranking member of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee,i
334,We are committed to working with Congress to explore ways to maintain or enhance environmental benefits of clean fuels programs while exploring ways to increase the flexibility of the fuels distribution infrastructure and minimize costs,r
335,The USGS has actively participated in two previous Federal reviews of MTBE and other oxygenates in gasoline,i
336,They have plenty of power already and influence as they demonstrated by instructing the Republican caucus to go pass this tax bill,i
337,We are still overly dependent on foreign oil from countries that clearly we have seen especially over the last 15 years do not represent our interests and values,i
338,Notably the agencies appearing today along with many others signed an MOU in April seeking to establish a cooperative relationship and expedite authorizations of major infrastructure projects including hydropower facilities,r
339,A leading example is the Energy Star Program which is delivering significant results,i
340,So only the lobby and one exam room had electricity but they needed full electricity to meet the demands of their patients,i
341,They include the bioremediation of mixed waste at many of the contaminated DOE sites the witchs brew that we have left from the legacy of cold war also the enhanced sequestration of carbon by the terrestrial and marine biosphere in order to reduce the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and also as has already been mentioned the production of clean fuels such as hydrogen through the miracles of biotechnology,r
342,My personal opinion based on what happened about that history as well as what happened with privatized spent fuel storage was that you could have a willing host community,i
343,The first one is that world oil demand has grown rapidly in the last several years putting upward pressure on price,r
344,To promote economic growth and strengthen security President Obama has called for an alloftheabove strategy that develops every source of American energy,r
345,Just last month the company was even touted by President Obama for having innovators and creating jobs that will foster our economic recovery and create clean technology to power our longterm prosperity,i
346,That is something it seems to me the Energy and Commerce Committee and particularly this subcommittee should make a high priority,i
347,In approving our report Secretary Abraham said The management of the nuclear weapons complex is my most important responsibility as Secretary of Energy,i
348,Electric reliability and environmental protection are both important to this countrys future,i
349,I think one of the things just to add is our COINF2INF emissions from energy consumption are down 13 percent since 2007 so this is already actually happening,i
350,These are good solid domestic jobs that get created with energy efficiency,i
351,She thought everybody had asthma because they are all breathing that diesel smoke and toxic fumes,r
352,Back in 2017 the FCC teed up the 24 gigahertz band in particular the appropriate protection limits in terms of the power emissions and the like for devices that would be using these bands for purposes of 5G,i
353,The National Academy of Sciences has referred to the US electricity grid as the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th century because it delivers critical energy services to consumers in an instantaneous affordable and dependable manner,i
354,This outbreak prompted Congress to act with the Energy and Commerce Committee taking the lead in the House through a series of investigations and hearings on the issue,i
355,As Chairman Shimkus stated the 21st Century Transportation Fuel Act Discussion Draft takes a larger view of Federal transportation fuel policies,i
356,Our nations comprehensive energy policy must ensure an affordable reliable supply of energy and nuclear energy provides one of the solutions to several policy challenges that our nation faces,r
357,Once a public health emergency has been declared MSEHPA allows authorities the power to seize private property for public use that is reasonable and necessary to respond to the public health emergency,i
358,Soand the other thing I would add is that they are not clean or completely fossilfuel free the way that renewables are,r
359,Even using power from traditional coal plants to charge a plug in hybrid is environmentally superior for CO2 and criteria pollutants to driving a regular Toyota Prius,r
360,Hes accompanied by Pat Hoffman Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Office of Electricity who can provide technical perspective from her experience addressing cybersecurity and energy emergency functions,i
361,As you all know the first export of LNG to scheduled to happen later this month maybe early March at Sabine Pass in Louisiana right next to Texas my own State,i
362,Given the potential impacts of EPAs proposed rules on the bulk power system such coordination is critical to ensuring that EPA does not enforce its rules in a vacuum,i
363,Moreover there is no reason to believe that such activities have had or will have any practical impact on the pursuit of nuclear weapons by proliferating states on the comprehensive diplomatic efforts ongoing to address these threats or on the possible modernization of nuclear weapons by China or Russia,i
364,Strong economic growth particularly in China and the United States is fueling a surge in oil demand,r
365,Under the Federal Power Act the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission known as FERC oversees electricity markets and the physical and virtual products traded within them,i
366,We support requiring all lightduty vehicles starting in 2023 to be designed specifically to run on this fuel on at least a 95 octane rating and potentially higher,i
367,And then let me ask you when you talked about health and safety of the American folks in looking at the endangerment ruling I am wondering if you all looked at the fact because you mentioned something about the heat being higher causing folks to have strokes or heart attacks etc and I am wondering if you looked at the fact that with the electric rates going up the heating bills going up fuel oil going up that there are a lot of folks in my district who are having a hard time paying for their heat and what is the offset on the other side,i
368,The method can accept a variety of feedstocks including natural gas coal and biomass,i
369,In early June 2008 the MDH received data from concerned citizens that included measurements of elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide in the ambient air in their community,i
370,I dont know that we are going to pick and choose the generation sources or the energy sources that is where the American peoplefor other policymakers,i
371,It is in the national interest and the interest for our economy to get this going and Texans we are understanding of energy issues and the necessity of getting energy to market,i
372,And there have been a few sites like in Monroe Michigan where there is actually an assembly plant for wind energy,r
373,Americas hydrocarbon renaissance has given us the gift of time,r
374,Diesel is the way of the future and I am hopeful that its shortterm benefits will not be overlooked by the Administration or the Congress even as we examine longer term strategies,r
375,A customer with a basic meter gets no informational feedback on how and when they are using electricity or information they can apply to their future electricity purchases,i
376,We doare very interested as I said in my remarks want to see the full investigation because we want to understand was there something else people were looking at that caused them to make the decisions they made as opposed to making the decisions that almost any of our drilling operations people would have made differently that led to the ultimate loss of the well,i
377,Number 2 you have got to have six greenhouse gases so the lowhanging fruit that can be accomplished by changes that reduce other greenhouse gases like methane or NOx any of those the hydrofluorocarbons et cetera can help get rid of it,r
378,Senator Dorgan you testified that after reviewing several recent studies on the impacts of LNG exports the Bipartisan Policy Center and Energy Board concluded that domestic gas prices are more likely to drive export levels than exports are likely to determine domestic prices,r
379,No market participant in interstate wholesale electric markets should be immune from FERCs investigative and remedial authority,i
380,Intense foreign competition from Stateowned enterprises poses another challenge for US companies particularly in the civil nuclear sector,i
381,Republicans claimed thenjust as they do nowthat the solution was to produce more oil domestically,r
382,Some are reliably available 24 hours a day and seven days a week and ideal for baseload power while others are not,i
383,We have also engaged the Department of Interior the Department of Energy the National Laboratories and the Department of Defense in discussions related to security,i
384,However while we look forward to advanced nuclear technology development it is long overdue to solve our Nations nuclear waste disposal challenge,r
385,Four US States Minnesota Montana Idaho and North Dakota account for 75 percent of all the natural gas brought into the United States via pipeline,r
386,Siemens Ford and Volvo have all made engines that reduce particulate emissions by more than 90 percent and nitric oxides similarly remarkably reduced,r
387,It is helpful to have this update on electricity restructuring issues and I am pleased that transmission issues will be covered in a separate hearing because it is one of the most critical components of any restructuring plan,i
388,But Cellular South which is our homeowned cellular company and BellSouth which is our biggest provider and also is a partner in Cingular again their people have worked untold hours just like the electric utility people and made huge sacrifices,i
389,I hope in my discussions with you today that that commitment on my part will come through to you in talking a little bit about what I plan to do and how I plan to bring my experience and my expertise that I have gained in the private sector in the nuclear industry over the years into this project to move it forward smartly in the time that I am in this job and that is my commitment to you,r
390,We believe to create a truly competitive vibrant energy industry these constraints should be removed,i
391,3 would additionally allow substitutions of Transportation Control Measures in a SIP without revisiting the SIP approval process or making a new conformity determination provided that the new measures achieve an equal or greater emissions reduction,r
392,test for generation market power Since beginning to grant marketbased rates rate deregulation to public utilities in the 1980s the Commission primarily focused on the applicant and employed a hubandspoke analysis to determine whether an individual entity and its affiliates have generation market power,i
393,I look forward to todays hearing to examine the challenges and opportunities to modernize our electric grid,i
394,That is why Canadas oil sands is nearly as valuable as an example of energy policy done right as it is for the oil itself,r
395,The problem is that if we look ahead and we look at the fact that natural gas is still a fossil fuel comes with CO2 emissions a coaltogas switch will just not be enough to meet our climate goals,r
396,This bill would require the Secretary of Energy to establish a program relating to the physical security and cybersecurity for pipelines and liquefied natural gas facilities,r
397,I would want the knowledge and education that allowed me to navigate the system and make my own appropriate decisions for myself and my children and I would want the power to determine my own fate and the power to change the situation,i
398,Texas Pacific and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts the famous KKR purchased Texas Utility Corporation and agreed to terminate 8 of 11 proposed coalfired power plants,r
399,The United States has such incredible energy abundance,i
400,Remove Market Barriers The first problem we need to solve is a procedural barrier that keeps solar energy from accessing the electricity market,r
401,When they heard about President Obamas proposal to put a tax of 10 on a barrel of American crude oil they all said what the heck what is he thinking,i
402,In addition we recently received an early site permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission which certifies that our site in Clinton Illinois where we operate one nuclear reactor meets all necessary criteria for construction of a new nuclear unit,r
403,The fuel diversity should be a cornerstone of our national energy policy as an important hedge against supply disruptions and price volatility,r
404,Lawmakers must examine the welltowheels cost and impact of EVs from power plant energy distribution to battery disposal,r
405,As you will hear today however we believe that elements of the alternative fuels discussion draft as currently constructed will not fully achieve those objectives and may ultimately be counterproductive,r
406,They are the ones who bear the brunt of higher energy prices and supply disruptions,i
407,So can you explain to why you thinkyou know I realize you decrease emissions but I just am not convinced that that particularly will change much the overall lifecycle of carbon emissions with the batterythe development of the batteries and what it costs to do that when you plug it in how the power is generated,r
408,In fact a new EIA Commission Study concludes that oil refiners would have quote no problem quote meeting a requirement to produce 95 RON gasoline beginning in 2022 and assumes that refiners would meet that standard with E10 gasoline,r
409,A key responsibility of this Committee is to develop and ensure implementation of a Strategic Plan for disposition and consolidation of special nuclear material,r
410,Electricity generated from coal is used in all 50 states,r
411,Consumers determine energy consumption every day through their purchasing decisions and the use of the products they buy,i
412,So maybe someday we have this hole underground it can be used for longterm nuclear storage,r
413,I am concerned that you all dont get noticed under the Clean Power Plan for interaction about what is going to happen when the plants close down,i
414,We dont add carbon monoxide to make product look fresh beyond its code date,i
415,And I know that GE in my district is working on advanced battery manufacturing that will address storage capacity for renewables,r
416,I hope this doesnt echo across the Administration and the great folks of the Department of Energy and the Congress,i
417,Adoption of existing test procedures developed through the Energy Star program where energy conservation standards are proposed to be set based on Energy Star performance requirements is appropriate,i
418,I am president and CEO of Southwest Power Pool an organization for which I have worked 32 years,i
419,If thats the case for a State like Illinois if 40 percent of the power that we generate is nuclear what would that do to our national energy policy and the pocketbook issues what would it do to the price for the individual consumers,i
420,Has the RFS reduced the need for foreign oil,i
421,We see this in the programs that have received proposed budget increases like the 29 billion for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy a 40 percent increase,r
422,And does that make other forms of energy work better or does it replace them,i
423,We do send ethanol by barge as well but I think in this particular study what we are looking at is toxicity,i
424,Of course we are always concerned about keeping gasoline as affordable as possible and some critics of oil exports have raised fears of price spikes,i
425,That was in my energy business,i
426,The Federal Power Act requires FERC to balance those competing interests in issuing a license because no one use of a river for power drinking water irrigation recreation or other use should automatically take precedence,i
427,Rush I think too you know in the future we would do well to include Ms Glover in future discussions because energy efficiency sometimes just kind of gets pushed to the side,i
428,I look forward to the testimony and to identifying what may be possible to do while preserving the essential roles of heavyduty engine power in our economy and way of life,i
429,Mr Linn and Mr Duplessis obviously with this being the largest oil spill in the history of our country theres lots of media attention,i
430,The Clean Power Plan I think makes a lot of sense moving forward,r
431,STATEMENTS OF RODNEY MASNEY VICE PRESIDENT TECHNOLOGY SERVICE DELIVERY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OWENSILLINOIS THOMAS D BIANCULLI CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION DR THOMAS R KURFESS PROFESSOR AND CHAIR IN FLUID POWER AND MOTION CONTROL GEORGE W WOODRUFF SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY SANJAY POONEN CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER VMWARE STATEMENT OF MR MASNEY Mr Masney,i
432,Certainly methane capture from landfills is fairly easy to measure,i
433,And three accelerate the deployment of clean energy infrastructure,r
434,One of the crazy things the FDA does not have subpoena power,i
435,I think in the latter part of December in the midcontinent area if you went out and tried to buy gas it was very difficult,i
436,So what we say is we support a vigorous RD program both in reactor development and in recycling reprocessing spent fuel,r
437,As the FERC commissioners make clear in their letter a thorough assessment of the impacts of for example the proposed Clean Power Plan requires the ongoing input of diverse perspectives and expertise,r
438,We dont harness the electricity we can from natural gas we dont sell it we dont pull it up we dont benefit the economy from it,r
439,In addition to being President and CEO of CONSOL Energy I want to tell you a little bit about Mr Harvey,i
440,Electric cooperatives comprise a unique component of the industry,i
441,A special report of the Institutes oxygenates evaluation committee Cambridge MA Health Effects Institute April 1996 httpwwwhealtheffectsorgPubsoxysumhtm National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences 2002 MTBE in gasoline National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences March 13 2002 httpwwwniehsnihgovexternalfaqgashtm SUP13SUP Toccalino supra citing inter alia National Science and Technology Council 1996 Interagency assessment of potential health risks associated with oxygenated gasoline Washington DC National Science and Technology Council Committee on Environment and Natural Resources February 1996 httpwwwostpgovNSTChtmlMTBEmtbetophtml Office of Science and Technology Policy 1997 Interagency assessment of oxygenated fuels Washington DC Office of Science and Technology Policy National Science and Technology Council Executive Office of the President of the United States June 1997 264 p httpwwwepagovomsregsfuelsostpfinpdf U S Environmental Protection Agency 1997 Drinking water advisory Consumer acceptability advice and health effects analysis on methyl tertiarybutyl ether MTBE Washington DC U S Environmental Protection Agency Office of Water EPA822F97009 December 1997 48 p httpwwwepagovwatersciencedrinkingmtbepdf,i
442,I believe the Department of Energy actually flew a Saab into the US to get some testing done at Oak Ridge recently but there is technology available,i
443,No one has the authority to look at the big picture of how hydro fits into our national energy policy,i
444,I appear this morning on behalf of the National Association of Convenience Stores NACS and the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America SIGMA,i
445,We have frequently analyzed the consequence of lower world oil prices on different regions of the world,i
446,So I am a bit confused because Ms McCabe testified that the EPA found that fuel efficiency technology development was moving faster than they had expected and is being implemented in the early years of the program,r
447,There have been provisions I have disagreed with and think we should revisit like on biomass from forests not counting toward renewable fuel standards seems to be rather absurd,r
448,These individuals in turn will become the qualified skilled workforce that the energy and manufacturing industries need,i
449,Well let me just ask you this then are you basing determinations on LNG exports in part on those discussions with the G7 nations,i
450,Why should we wait for a great big energy bill which may or may not come during your lifetime and mine,i
451,One industry study estimates that there will be 600000 career opportunities for women and minorities in energy in the years ahead,i
452,As you indicated my name is David Duquette and I chair the US Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board Executive Committee,i
453,These include modernizing the electric grid by using proven technologies to better contain outages reduce recovery times and lower operating costs,i
454,We know that Chinas use of coal and the world has grown from 20 percent to about 30 percent now and it is expected to get to use 40 percent of the worlds coal in the next 15 years or so we know that Chinas emissions have grown by 80 percent since 1990 and they are expected to grow another 65 percent by the year 2020,i
455,That is going to put pressure on conservation,i
456,What we also do is allow forwhat the legislation does it allow for technology limits 60 percent I think to one technology 90 percent for two and what that is doing there is saying that although wind today is the cheapest form of renewable power generation ultimately because of these cost curves you want to induce more competition and to see oil prices continue to come down,r
457,fuel receipt and the transportation systems to be compatible with the currently NRC licensed storagetransportation systems then they could classify the fuel in those systems as nonstandard causing that fuel to lose its place in the DOEs fuel acceptance queue,i
458,I am determined to work with my colleagues to do everything in our power to preserve this important State right,i
459,It goes actually to the heart of what I have talked about which is when you look at energy independence and we look at developing as part of a national security strategy and having an energy policy when you look at those refineries and 30 percent being owned by foreign interests when you look at 30 percent of our oil or 27 being imported into the United States if you want to look at it at a freemarket perspective we dont have a free market,r
460,I thank you and the Chair of the full committee for your leadership on the American Clean Energy and Security Act,i
461,The Agency views the issue of electronics recycling as one of resource conservation and solid waste management and so do CEA and its members,i
462,Im frustrated that the Bush administration is decimating important R D programs and not establishing realistic and attainable goals for our energy future,i
463,And I guess it is a fine line between market uncertainty and price gouging in many of our minds because people price gouge because consumers are uncertain and they know gas costs are rising correct,i
464,Diesel trucks are paying 450 a gallon for diesel,i
465,Governor Corzine has made it clear that lowering energy prices is important for our economic Mr Shimkus,i
466,Additional material submitted for the record follows Knoxville Utilities Board and Memphis Light Gas Water DiVision INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY Memphis Light Gas and Water Memphis and Knoxville Utilities Board Knoxville submit this statement for the record of the Committees hearings on electric industry restructuring issues to set forth their views on the need for legislation related to the Tennessee Valley Authority TVA,i
467,There is a hearing downstairs on energy,i
468,In addition I believe an amendment to the FPA to give the Commission authority to assess penalties in addition to refunds and interest could act as a powerful deterrent against the abuse of market power,i
469,They must strike a demanding balance between first cost cost of operation and technical features to minimize energy consumption,i
470,The other thing we can do is to make sure that any difficulties associated with splashblended ethanol are addressed by allowing us to incorporate ethanol into other ethers for example ETBE,r
471,So this war on coal must stop,r
472,Electrifying millions of American buildings will require sensors smart grid solar batteries carbon capture and storage the Internet of Things cloud computing mobile computing edge computing,i
473,We are the worlds largest economy but if we do some things that are very draconian on our emissions here in the United States and really all it does is cost us jobs I am very skeptical that the rest of the world is going to follow suit,r
474,There is no question that the oxygenate ability of ethanol is a positive,r
475,Under this scenario a state could never achieve attainment status with its own efforts rather the ability of states to reach attainment would depend on the willingness not only of other states but also of nations around the globe to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,r
476,If we really do something about climate change by reducing COINF2INF emissions and reduced demand for oil can that help us restrain the price increases of oil,r
477,We can all agree that we do need some oil and gas development,r
478,NRC currently bills its licensees or applicants about 263 per hour which is a high burden on companies seeking to develop new nuclear technologies,i
479,Are weas we move forward in supplementing initial fuelsalternative fuels,i
480,Instead what weve learned from a steady stream of press reports and congressional hearings is that bullet EPA in fact concluded that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public welfare and submitted its finding to OMB in December of last year,r
481,Reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is the right move to make but we should focus on that goal and not lose perspective,r
482,It took over a year in production and it analyzed all of the various means open to us in terms of investing in energy efficiency technologies,i
483,Benefiting from the economyofscale by operating and servicing a larger number of nuclear plants within a single organization these companies will be in a position to handle the financial and technological challenges that must be managed in launching the next generation of nuclear plants,r
484,History is on the side of those who want to act on climate change those who believe in the power of American innovation and our ability to successfully meet any challenge and who look to the future rather than the past,r
485,Mr Blake we have noted that since the NES was adopted the National Energy Strategy that opened the wholesale markets in electricity the wholesale market has increased by 400 percent and prices have steadily declined in the wholesale market during that period of time,i
486,There is an analysis that is going to be released in the coming weeks by the National Commission on Energy Policy,i
487,And I see no way that energy costs are going down,i
488,Chairman Shimkus I would like to point out one in particular the suspension of the Nuclear Waste Fund which we argued we needed to do,r
489,Production off Louisianas shore alone contributes an average of 5 billion a year to the Federal Treasury and that was when oil was less than the 68abarrelplus today,r
490,There were no septic systems no water systems and they ended up drilling their own wells and they become really a problem,i
491,I also urge that any proposal considered by this committee have the best interests of electricity consumers in mind including the promotion of conservation and renewable and innovative energy sources,r
492,So the advantages that you would get from lets say maybe keeping a lid on the Brent price which affects gasoline pricethat advantage still exists and meanwhile the refineries are still operating,r
493,I am privileged to chair the Subcommittee on Commerce Trade and Consumer Protection and my friend and colleague Mr Boucher who is the chairman of the Communications Technology and Internet Subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Commerce,i
494,We have Mr Adam Sieminski Chief Energy Economist Deutsche Bank,i
495,New teams will come with expertise something like auditors with expertise in energy trading something like that and if they wont perform theyll be thrown out,i
496,Mr Caruso your testimony focuses on the supply side of natural gas,i
497,We are currently bound to a petroleum infrastructure and before drivers will purchase a fuel cell vehicle they have to have confidence in a hydrogen refueling infrastructure,r
498,Also consistent with NPC recommendations the program promotes maximum collaboration between the federal government industry and academia and it establishes a program that is an order of magnitude larger than the Department of Energys existing gas supply RD program,r
499,So in a tangible way the natural gas prices do affect our operations because of the energy costs,i
