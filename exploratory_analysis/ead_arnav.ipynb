      "today's subject. I am an economist by training and have spent \n",
      "my career managing financial risks. I worked at Goldman Sachs \n",
      "for 23 years. I was a partner and head of the firm Wide Risk \n",
      "Department.\n",
      "    I now sit on several boards for groups that study and \n",
      "propose responses to climate risks, including the Climate \n",
      "Leadership Council and the Niskanen Center. No doubt, the \n",
      "reason I am here today is because in 2020 I chaired the CFTC \n",
      "Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee, which published a \n",
      "unanimous and widely cited report, Managing Climate Risk in the \n",
      "U.S. Financial System. We had environmental organizations, such \n",
      "as the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund, \n",
      "but also Agri business companies like Cargill and Bunge. Oil \n",
      "and gas companies like Conoco Phillips and BP, and banks like \n",
      "Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Citi.\n",
      "    There was no collection of wide-eyed environmental \n",
      "activists nor were politics involved. This was a rigorous \n",
      "report with dozens of recommendations from hard-headed experts \n",
      "and we came to the unanimous conclusion that climate change \n",
      "poses significant risks to the American economy that must be \n",
      "addressed urgently.\n",
      "    In the Agricultural sector, for example, we found that \n",
      "climate change is likely to significantly reduce crop yields, \n",
      "decrease labor productivity, degrade soil and water quality, \n",
      "increase the range and virulence of pests and disrupt supply \n",
      "chains. Climate change will also impose large costs on \n",
      "companies and governments.\n",
      "    One example, the CFTC Report, highlighted with the case of \n",
      "Pacific Gas and Electric in California which entered bankruptcy \n",
      "because of $30 billion in liabilities associated with its \n",
      "infrastructure, sparking record wildfires. Extreme weather \n",
      "impacts are already here and are growing rapidly, including \n",
      "heatwaves, floods, hurricanes, drought, and wildfires.\n",
      "    Meanwhile, the effects of climate change loom every larger \n",
      "in the future. Losses from billion-dollar extreme weather \n",
      "events totaled $165 billion last year. And while it varies from \n",
      "year to year, the costs from climate change are clearly growing \n",
      "rapidly. Extreme weather events are becoming more common as the \n",
      "atmosphere warms. Terms such as the 100-Year Flood are used to \n",
      "describe the magnitude of an event that has happened \n",
      "historically on average once every hundred years. That happens \n",
      "to be an important frequency.\n",
      "    We build infrastructure to withstand events that happen on \n",
      "a regular basis and so the damage created by weather that \n",
      "happens regularly is small. But when a 100-year event occurs, \n",
      "the magnitude is so large that we're not prepared and it \n",
      "typically leads to complete destruction of property. The \n",
      "problem is that while such a term continues to describe the \n",
      "magnitude of extreme weather events the frequency of occurrence \n",
      "today tends to be much higher.\n",
      "    Declining real estate values driven by climate-related \n",
      "impacts or the expectation of such impacts in the future could \n",
      "substantially depress regional economic activity in exposed \n",
      "areas. Climate change will also likely inflict large costs on \n",
      "human health and its impacts will fall hardest on those with \n",
      "fewer resources, increasing inequity.\n",
      "    There are also a number of risks related to crossing a \n",

      "response of a system and there are a number of warning \n",
      "potential tipping points in the climatic system. More worrying \n",
      "still, recent scientific research suggests that we may cross \n",

      "warming it may cross several additional ones with 2 degrees of \n",
      "warming.\n",
      "    While the subject of this hearing is the economic risks and \n",
      "costs associated with climate change, I would be remiss if I \n",
      "did not mention one last thing. All of the research and \n",
      "analysis on this subject agrees that the sooner we act to \n",

      "    In addition, a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy \n",
      "will, by removing policy uncertainty, likely actually result in \n",
      "substantial investment and increased economic growth.\n",
      "    I have lots of ideas on this subject, but the bottom line \n",
      "is that with global average temperatures already having risen \n",
      "over 1 degree C and with potentially catastrophic tipping \n",

      "    Dr. Holtz-Eaken. Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member \n",
      "Grassley, and members of the Committee, thank you for the \n",
      "privilege of being here today. Let me make three points quickly \n",
      "and then I look forward to the chance to answer your questions.\n",
      "    The first point is that climate change will have real \n",
      "impacts on the U.S. economy and these will worsen the federal \n",
      "budget outlook. Unquestionably, there will be additional \n",
      "outlays from the national flood insurance programs and other \n",
      "disaster crop risks kinds of programs and mandatory outlays. \n",
      "The Congress will probably chose to make some discretionary \n",
      "outlays in the future in response to the needs for mitigation \n",
      "and/or adaptation and these will worsen the budget picture, but \n",
      "the biggest impact is going to be lower revenue from an economy \n",
      "that grows more slowly over the long term and that the loss of \n",
      "some capital assets, diminished labor productivity, diminished \n",
      "productivity in agricultural lands will cumulatively reduce \n",
      "inflows to the federal budget.\n",
      "    The Congressional Budget Office recently took a look at \n",
      "this issue and concluded that the center point of set of \n",
      "estimates for the impact would be about a percentage point \n",
      "lower in GDP by 2051. And I would just point out that while \n",
      "that's a significant impact it's tantamount to under a tenth of \n",
      "a percentage point slower growth each and every year.\n",
      "    In contrast, and this point number two, the federal budget \n",
      "presents an immediate and much larger economic threat. We \n",
      "already have debt to GEP in the range of 100 percent and \n",
      "there's a large literature that stems from the work of Ken \n",
      "Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart indicates that countries in that \n",
      "range experience slower growth on the order of a percentage \n",
      "point per year because of their debt burdens. And the U.S. not \n",
      "only has entered that range it has a budget outlook which is \n",
      "unsustainable.\n",
      "    The CBO will put out a revised Economic and Budget Outlook \n",
      "this afternoon at 2 o'clock. It will doubtlessly look like the \n",
      "one they put out last year that shows spending expending \n",
      "revenues as far as the eye can see, driven by very rapid growth \n",
      "in the outlays in Medicare at 7 percent a year, Social Security \n",
      "at 6 percent a year, faster than any revenue source could \n",
      "possibly grow and as a result it will show debt relative to GDP \n",
      "rising as far as the eye can see. The interest costs of \n",
      "carrying that debt rising as far as can see and that is a \n",
      "mechanism which is a guarantee for slower growth in the future.\n",
      "    The point of the borrowing is not just the debt. The point \n",
      "is that that brings resources from the private sector into the \n",
      "government sector. And for every dollar you take from private \n",
      "investment and put into the best of federal infrastructure \n",
      "investments, you lose about 50 percent of the rate of return, \n",
      "so you're losing on every one of those borrowing activities, \n",
      "diminishing the productivity in the economy, lowering the \n",
      "standard of living for future workers in the next generations.\n",
      "    We really don't spend a lot of money on investments in this \n",
      "program and more than likely we're going to take that money \n",
      "from a private investment and put it into a consumption \n",
      "expenditure. That's the point of Social Security and Medicare \n",
      "is to raise the standard of living in retirement for seniors. \n",
      "There's no rate of return to consumption investment, so the \n",
      "federal budget is the biggest headwind to economic growth \n",
      "because it is stacked against investing in the future and needs \n",
      "to be brought into some sort sustainable alignment in order to \n",
      "stop these headwinds to growth.\n",
      "    The other point that's going on in the federal budget is \n",
      "that the mandatory expenditures are crowding out discretionary \n",
      "spending. Discretionary spending is where we do national \n",
      "security, basic research, infrastructure, education, all the \n",
      "places where you can invest in the future of the country and \n",
      "those opportunities are getting squeezed out by the growth of \n",
      "these mandatory programs.\n",
      "    So, point number three, not only would getting the budget \n",
      "on a sustainable trajectory improve the economic outlook, it \n",
      "would free up the budget resources through investments, \n",
      "especially investments in the climate mitigation and adaptation \n",
      "that are so important to this Committee and to this hearing.\n",
      "    And so, I can't think of a single bigger accomplishment \n",
      "than for this Committee and the U.S. Congress to finally come \n",
      "to grips with the federal budget outlook and its \n",
      "unsustainability. It lies at the crossroads of all the threats \n",
      "to our future and needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.\n",
      "    I thank you for the chance to be here today. I look forward \n",
      "to your questions.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I'll lead \n",
      "and then Senator Romney is next in line.\n",
      "    Dr. Carney, you've held two of the most significant and \n",
      "powerful positions global in the banking sector. Climate change \n",
      "was not customarily a part of the banking sector's interest. \n",
      "Why is it that you took such an interest I addressing climate \n",
      "change?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Chair. It goes back, in part, to \n",
      "your opening comments, some of the points you made in your \n",
      "opening comments, which is that under-investing in resilience \n",
      "upfront leads to much greater costs down the road. And it was \n",
      "particular when I became Governor at the Bank of England and \n",
      "it's not commonly known, but one of the responsibilities of the \n",
      "Bank of England is to oversee the insurance industry and it's \n",
      "the fourth largest insurance industry in the world. It includes \n",
      "one of the largest, if not the largest, re-insurance market, \n",
      "the famous Lords of London, and so therefore that's a property \n",
      "in casualty and re-insurance industry that's directly affected \n",
      "by climate change.\n",
      "    And one of the lessons that the brokers and the risk \n",
      "managers in Lord of London had determined was that the tail \n",
      "risk of the past were becoming the central scenario of the \n",
      "future. I'll refer to Dr. Litterman's comments about one in a \n",
      "hundred risk events becoming that much more frequent. So, of \n",
      "course they're adjusting pricing. They're adjusting coverage \n",
      "which as real implications for economies and it's apparent to \n",
      "us, as risk managers, that this will affect the economy more \n",
      "broadly and the financial system potentially more broadly if \n",
      "there is not adequate information to assess the potential \n",
      "degree of those risks. And if risk managers don't at least have \n",
      "the opportunity to determine whether or not they will take \n",
      "steps----\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Carney, you were in charge of the \n",
      "Bank of Canada after the 2008 financial crisis. Can you compare \n",
      "what you foresee with respect to climate with what you \n",
      "experienced in the 2008 mortgage crisis?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Well, there's two things that I would say. The \n",
      "first is that one of the experiences of that crisis, and many \n",
      "of the members, of course, lived through it and helped managed \n",
      "through it, is what's called a Minsky moment, a realization \n",
      "that basic assumptions were no longer true. For example, that \n",
      "health prices would never fall in the United States, that \n",
      "capital was money good, that assets off balance sheets would \n",
      "stay off balance sheets, all of those proved false and lead to \n",
      "the collapse or virtual collapse of the core, much of the core \n",
      "of the financial system with huge economic costs that \n",
      "ultimately have added to the debt burden of the United States, \n",
      "amongst other countries.\n",
      "    Now, in Canada, we were more fortunate for a variety of \n",
      "reasons, but one of the reasons was we had put more resilience \n",
      "into our financial institutions upfront.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. I'm not getting into Canada \n",
      "specifically. I'm looking between what you project potentially \n",
      "happening with the climate crisis. What's the scale comparison, \n",
      "in your mind, between what we experienced with the 2008 \n",
      "financial crisis and what climate portends for our systems?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Okay, so I'll just lead from that point. The \n",
      "first point is what we want to avoid is a rapid and sudden \n",
      "adjustment to the climate crisis, both adaptation, the impact \n",
      "of fiscal damage or belated investments to address the issue. \n",
      "The orders of magnitude are potentially similar in those cases \n",
      "if we delay adjustment.\n",
      "    If we adjust upfront, actually, I'm of the view that we can \n",
      "actually grow economies through the investments which would \n",
      "improve competitiveness. But if we delay it until it's evident, \n",
      "and this is the tragedy of the horizon supremely evident to \n",
      "everybody, then the orders of magnitude approaches the \n",
      "financial crisis.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. And just to be clear, your testimony \n",
      "is that climate change could reduce the level of global GDP per \n",
      "capita by 10 to 20 percent and in that calculation you leave \n",
      "out critical economic channels that have not been modeled, \n",
      "including disrupted supply chains, challenges to monetary and \n",
      "financial stability that increasing climate change will \n",
      "present, and potential economic impact of rising risks to \n",
      "national security; is that a fair summary?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. That is a fair summary. And one of the lessons \n",
      "of large shocks is they get amplified as they come through the \n",
      "financial sector. Yes.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Litterman, the papers we have in \n",
      "front of us are littered with the ``systemic risk.'' It seems \n",
      "like a mild little term. Could you give us a sense of what its \n",
      "impact is?\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. The system risk that's incorporated in \n",
      "climate change comes from the uncertainty about how the economy \n",
      "is going to be responding to the various different hazards that \n",
      "are increasing. So, we have whole areas of the country that may \n",
      "be impacted by extreme weather, Florida, for instance, that \n",
      "could lead to significant financial stress in terms of the \n",
      "ability to raise funds for capital. So, you can have \n",
      "significant systemic impacts on the economy. It's ones of those \n",
      "things we just don't know.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. You said cascade through the economy.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Excuse me?\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Systemic meaning it cascades through \n",
      "the economy and the sectors.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Exactly. It will affect every aspect of the \n",
      "economy, including government budgets.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. And last question, you said you were \n",
      "hard-headed about your report. Explain?\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Yes, this is a report that was created by a \n",
      "bunch of scientists, academics, business people, investor, and \n",
      "we came to unanimous agreement. It wasn't about, I don't know, \n",
      "gut feeling. It was about facts. And the problem is we don't \n",
      "know what the future is going to bring, so we have to be \n",
      "prepared. It's very simple.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Good word to end on. I think my clock \n",
      "started a little bit late, so if the Ranking Member would like \n",
      "to go a little bit beyond that would be--all's fair. And I turn \n",
      "to Senator Grassley, Senator Padilla next, Senator Romney next, \n",
      "unless Senator Marshall returns.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Dr. Holtz-Eakin, our rising deficits are \n",
      "cast by a lot of people as long-term challenge, ``long-term \n",
      "challenge.'' Something we will have to deal with in the future, \n",
      "but not immediate problem today. Is that really the case or are \n",
      "we already living with the consequences of reckless spending \n",
      "and borrowing?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, I certainly believe the impacts are \n",
      "immediate and shouldn't be put off. Most people characterize \n",
      "the threat as something that looks like, you know, a Greece, \n",
      "Portugal sovereign meltdown that would happen somewhere in the \n",
      "future if we just did nothing, but the reality is that the \n",
      "mechanism I described in my opening remarks, the diminished \n",
      "productivity, the headwinds to raising the standard of living \n",
      "are going on in small amounts every single year.\n",
      "    It might be too tiny to notice in the moment, but \n",
      "cumulatively there are an enormous impact on our progress and \n",
      "so I think it's something that needs to be rectified \n",
      "immediately, both in and of itself, but also because it would \n",
      "allow the Congress more flexibility in pursuing other policy \n",
      "objectives.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Also to you, in last week's State of the \n",
      "Union address, the President once again tried to portray \n",
      "himself as deficit reducer. He pointed to last year's $1.4 \n",
      "trillion deficit, which was lower than the 2002 deficits due to \n",
      "cessation by bipartisan pandemic relief. So, to you how would \n",
      "you rate the President's budgetary performance so far?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I think the Administration has done \n",
      "nothing to improve the budgetary outlook. Certainly, if you \n",
      "look back at 2021, the American Rescue Plan was an enormous \n",
      "policy error. Something I said at the time, so it's not 20/20 \n",
      "hindsight. It was a two trillion dollar stimulus in an economy \n",
      "that was growing at 6 percent. I was too big, was unnecessary, \n",
      "was poorly designed, lead to a lot of inflation, and this has \n",
      "been followed by several proposals called Build Back Better, \n",
      "but did not add up in any meaningful way and would have added \n",
      "to the core structural deficit in the United States.\n",
      "    He's taken administrative actions for hundreds of billions \n",
      "of dollars in student loan relief that are difficult for me to \n",
      "defend, so I don't see any activities being taken by the \n",
      "Administration that are recognizing the problems that federal \n",
      "budget faces and we need some leadership on that front.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Dr. Carney, in last week's State of the \n",
      "Union address, President Biden admitted that the U.S. will need \n",
      "oil and gas ``for a while.'' Your firm, Brookfield Asset \n",
      "Management, has invested in oil and gas infrastructure around \n",
      "the world. Do you believe that the U.S. Government should \n",
      "mandate private institutions divest from their fossil fuel \n",
      "interests, and if so, what immediate impact would this have on \n",
      "the average American?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. The first thing, I agree with the President and \n",
      "the timeline in continued need for fossil fuel. Secondly, I'll \n",
      "just note Brookfield is one of the largest investors in \n",
      "renewables and operators of renewables in the world. Thirdly, \n",
      "no, I don't believe and I've never advocated mandatory \n",
      "divestment of fossil fuels assets. In fact, to address the \n",
      "climate challenge what is necessary to get capital financing to \n",
      "where the emissions are and ensure that businesses can invest \n",
      "to get those emissions down and that's been a consistent \n",
      "position I've had for more than a decade.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Yes. I don't have a question, but you \n",
      "said--even though I have 1 and 12 seconds left, I'd like to \n",
      "just make a statement, but it's kind of a question for \n",
      "information from Dr. Litterman and Dr. Carney and it deals with \n",
      "the ESG movements within finance, within banking. And I know \n",
      "you don't have to invest where you don't want to invest, but as \n",
      "a family farmer in Iowa and my son, Robin, runs the family \n",
      "farm, but we're corn/soybean farmers.\n",
      "    So, let's just assume that the FDIC or some other regulator \n",
      "or bank say to the community bank in Parkersburg, Iowa that \n",
      "you've got to make sure that you know what the carbon footprint \n",
      "is of the farmer and in 60 years of arming I don't know where \n",
      "to start to answer that question. And then I think--so what is \n",
      "obligation that banker is under an obligation to get that \n",
      "information from me, but if the farmer can't give the \n",
      "information how does it get out? So this is what I'm thinking \n",
      "as a historic farming. When I started farming in 1960, we'd \n",
      "make 10 trips across the field and produce maybe 60 bushel of \n",
      "corn to the acre.\n",
      "    Today with minimum tillage or no tillage, we make about \n",
      "three or four trips across and we produce--in Iowa, I think the \n",
      "average farmer produced 204 bushels of corn to acre. So, you \n",
      "can see that farmers are already producing unit of food with a \n",
      "lot less units of energy than they used to and do we get any \n",
      "credit for that? I mean we've already been helping the global \n",
      "warming issue with more efficient farming and all that. But \n",
      "that banker in Parkersburg can say to Chuck Grassley you tell \n",
      "us what your carbon footprint is.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Senator, it's not an issue of reporting what \n",
      "your carbon footprint is. We don't have to be aware of what the \n",
      "carbon flux out of the atmosphere into the ground is and \n",
      "there's tremendous opportunity for farmers to actually address \n",
      "this problem, to sequester carbon into their soil so they can \n",
      "change the way they farm. But we do have to address the \n",
      "problem. We have to measure the carbon. We have to understand \n",
      "the science. There's a tremendous opportunity in farming, in \n",
      "ranching, and in timberlands to address this problem and I hope \n",
      "we do.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Well, what'd you think we been doing? We \n",
      "have been using midland tillage for 25 years, no till for \n",
      "probably about that long.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Well, sadly, the farmers have not been \n",
      "compensated for the things that they have done to sequester \n",
      "carbon into the soil. They are compensated for being more \n",
      "efficient, but we haven't recognized carbon. Carbon movement \n",
      "into and out of the atmosphere is something that we need to be \n",
      "aware of. We need to measure it and we need to create \n",

      "incentives to reduce emissions. Let's just do it.\n",

      "    First question is for Dr. Carney. Can you talk about how \n",
      "the climate crisis disproportionately impacts these already \n",
      "marginalized communities and the importance of equity in our \n",

      "    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Senator, for the question. Yes, it \n",
      "is an unfortunate reality that climate change has these \n",
      "impacts, in part, through--well, through the direct areas in \n",
      "which many disadvantaged communities live, proximity, for \n",
      "example, to our coasts and of course this Committee will know \n",
      "that 40 percent of Americans are living within \\1/8\\ of a mile \n",

      "going to be facing around the world, but certainly in America \n",
      "as well, businesses and families feasibility to get insurance \n",
      "coverage. As these impacts become more prominent, the ability \n",
      "to afford it, if it is available, and of course, so for \n",

      "of climate, you talk a lot about carbon footprints. How do you \n",
      "assess the cradle to grave impacts of what you're looking at? \n",
      "How do you calculate the cost of implementing your policies? \n",
      "And I'm going to give you a ``for instance.''\n",
      "    So, like Iowa, Kansas, over 50 percent of our electricity \n",
      "is generated from wind. Unfortunately, wind energy is seven \n",
      "times more per kilowatt to produce than from natural gas. Solar \n",
      "is probably 70 times per kilowatt more than from natural gas. \n",
      "And then when we transport that electricity, transporting \n",
      "electricity is 10 times more expensive than transporting \n",
      "natural gas. So, we're exporting a lot of that wind generator \n",
      "electricity and the cost of generating it and transporting is--\n",
      "you know, do the math, 70, 100 times more expensive.\n",
      "    So, my question, going back to you, Dr. Carney, is how do \n",
      "you address the entire cradle to grave impact of your policies, \n",
      "not just the carbon footprint and how do you calculate the cost \n",
      "of implementing your plans?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Thank you. Chair just cut me off when I used up \n",
      "too much time. Very quickly, I might refrain cradle to grave, \n",

      "energy. I would point out that the levelized cost of wind and \n",
      "solar, new wind and solar is now comparable, if not through, in \n",
      "many jurisdictions. It is less expensive than natural gas is \n",
      "the first point.\n",
      "    The second point, and of course, subject to fewer price \n",
      "fluctuations in local and world markets. And then a quick \n",
      "point, if I may, just to pick up on the fiscal point, I'll just \n",
      "read into the record that one of the most effective mechanisms, \n",
      "and the Chair referenced this at the start, is credible climate \n",
      "policy that would include regulation. And when you combine that \n",
      "with the financial sector and businesses having the right \n",
      "information, you get the investment in technologies that are \n",
      "efficient today, cost effective, and in the types of \n",

      "    Dr. Litterman. Sure. Insurance companies base their pricing \n",

      "them to raise the premium because based on what they say. Show \n",
      "me the data. Well, the data is changing every day. These things \n",
      "are becoming more and more likely and so the insurance markets \n",
      "are not working. Reinsurers understand this. They see the risks \n",
      "and they say we won't underwrite these losses because we see \n",
      "them coming and so these markets are just not working.\n",
      "    And then you get Florida, the federal government says we'll \n",
      "provide the flood insurance. California says taxpayers will \n",

      "    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've been four \n",
      "years on the Budget Committee each year and the last two years \n",
      "prior to this we did 16 hearings and we didn't do one hearing \n",
      "on the mechanics of actually doing a budget. This is the Budget \n",
      "Committee and we haven't put one together fully budgeted and \n",
      "appropriate on time in 25 years.\n",
      "    I've got four kids that now run my business, three of my \n",
      "four kids, and I was on a school board 10 years, state \n",
      "legislator for three years. No other place works like that and \n",
      "has a business plan that works into the future. I also come to \n",
      "the Senate and believe, as Republicans and conservatives, that \n",
      "if we don't weigh in on big issues of the day shame on us. Then \n",
      "we're going to be at the expense of whatever the other idea is.\n",
      "    Started the Climate Caucus back six months after I got \n",
      "here. Got six other Republicans to join and we've been an \n",
      "engaging caucus, a real caucus that's met over time. So, the \n",
      "issues are there, but I think until we--unless we want to \n",
      "change the name of this Committee to the General Issues of \n",
      "Concern Committee, we owe it to the American public that we're \n",
      "not going to base it upon doing no budgeting, no appropriating, \n",
      "doing it behind closed doors, and dropping 4100 page bills in \n",
      "our lap that none of us can read through and then having the \n",
      "gall to borrow the money from our kids and our grandkids. That \n",
      "is shameful.\n",
      "    We should be fleshing out the climate issues probably in \n",
      "EPW. I've been the loudest senator on the Republic side that \n",
      "says we have a broken healthcare system. Fixed it in my own \n",
      "business 15 years ago, made it consumer driven, but skin in the \n",
      "game from my own employees to be real healthcare consumers, cut \n",
      "costs by 50 percent, have not had premium increases in 15 \n",
      "years. That sounds like it'd be unbelievable, but it's true. \n",
      "When you do things that make sense and that are sustainable. \n",
      "You know I've got healthier employees for that now.\n",
      "    So, healthcare, it's breaking the bank in terms of \n",
      "mentioned earlier Medicare until you reform the healthcare \n",
      "industry and embrace competition, transparency, don't get \n",
      "hospitals all the rules and regs they need to become an \n",
      "unregulated utility like a monopoly in the sense of how they \n",
      "work, probably going to see costs going up.\n",
      "    So, I'm not going to weigh in on the climate issue, other \n",
      "than we've doing it. The experts there, the leaders and \n",
      "captains of industry I think are accepting it as an issue. It's \n",
      "going to be solved in that area through technology, not here. \n",
      "And it does beg the question when China's building a coal-fired \n",
      "plant weekly how does that hold thing fit into the equation?\n",
      "    So, I want to cite a few more statistics and then I'm going \n",
      "to ask Mr. Carney, who is out there in the cyber world and Dr. \n",
      "Holtz-Eakin, what you think about the trajectory we're on. The \n",
      "only budget out there that anybody's had the nerve to be I did \n",
      "it last year, privilege motion. We should discharge a budget \n",
      "resolution by April 1st. There'll be some of us that do that \n",
      "again, but just cutting to what we do do, which is no \n",
      "budgeting, no appropriating, and then whether you believe in \n",
      "reforming things on a climate basis and healthcare. What about \n",
      "the idea that we're adding trillions to our national debt, 18 \n",
      "trillion when I got here, now 31 trillion. Start back in 2000 \n",
      "when we put a couple wars on the credit card. That took us from \n",
      "5 trillion in debt to 10 trillion.\n",
      "    Next Administration said, well, we're not going to be \n",
      "outdone, added another 6 trillion. I get here it's 18 trillion. \n",
      "It's been off the rails ever since. Let's start with Mr. \n",
      "Carney. You come from the banking industry. I debated Bernie \n",
      "Sanders for 25 minutes on the Senate floor about the modern \n",
      "monetary theory. Can we keep borrowing and borrowing without \n",
      "having the consequences of crowding out all the issues that are \n",
      "going to come into play, is that a viable long-term business \n",
      "plan? And I'd like Dr. Holtz-Eakin to weigh in as well.\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Senator. I'll make a couple quick \n",
      "comments. The first is that crowding out is an issue. I think \n",
      "Professor Holtz-Eakin has made this point in this forum and \n",
      "other fora. And secondly, it is a relevant issue for climate \n",
      "change because of the cost of adaptation, resilience, and \n",
      "delayed action is going to lead to much greater crowding out \n",
      "and bigger economic impacts as well. So, the fiscal situation \n",
      "you described, and I won't' comment on obviously on U.S. \n",
      "situation, but this underscores the importance of revenue \n",
      "neutral use of regulation and effective policies that other \n",
      "senators have been referencing.\n",
      "    Last point I'll make before handing it over to the other \n",
      "witness is I would just refer, given the earlier discussion, to \n",
      "the carbon tax in Canada, which is revenue neutral, is returned \n",
      "to Canadians and insures about 70 percent of Canadian \n",
      "households. I'm going to net ahead.\n",
      "    Senator Braun. What about the modern monetary theory, \n",
      "climate aside?\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. I don't want to----\n",
      "    Senator Braun. I figured you may not weigh in on that. Go \n",
      "ahead.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. No, that's a theory to which I do not \n",
      "subscribe.\n",
      "    Senator Braun. Well, I can tell you it's a bad theory. \n",
      "Anywhere else you borrow from future generations it does not \n",
      "work out. Dr. Holtz-Eakin.\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, one, the federal budget is on an \n",
      "unsustainable structure and its getting worse. Two, it is \n",
      "imposing costs on the economy today and will increasingly \n",
      "impose those costs. The carving out is real. And three, there \n",
      "is nothing about modern monetary theory that coincides with the \n",
      "real-world experience. It's just incorrect.\n",
      "    Senator Braun. Yes. And thank you for that. And I think we \n",
      "should try to discharge a budget resolution by April 15th, if \n",
      "not, I will take one to the floor again because it's our \n",
      "responsibility to our kids and grandkids not to run this place \n",

      "\n",
      "    Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to take a \n",
      "brief moment to say that I appreciate the opportunity to serve \n",
      "on the Budget Committee as a new member and especially to do so \n",
      "at a time when the state of our federal budget is in such \n",
      "profound disrepair, perhaps more so than at any other time in \n",
      "our nation's history.\n",
      "    Fifteen years ago, our public debt measured as a percentage \n",
      "of the American economy, was at just 35 percent. Today it \n",
      "stands at 100 percent and according to fairly rosy projections \n",
      "within the next few decades it'll get up to 200 percent. And \n",
      "whether it's decades or just a few years away, we will reach a \n",
      "point where our interest on the national debt becomes the \n",
      "largest line item we have, bigger than Social Security or \n",
      "Medicare or Defense.\n",
      "    This fiscally irresponsible path that our federal budget is \n",
      "on is something that increases significantly the odds of a debt \n",
      "crisis and the associated economic pain that will inevitably be \n",
      "borne by the American public, if and when that crisis arrives \n",
      "in its full force.\n",
      "    Just last year the Congressional Budget Office noted that \n",
      "the very tangible consequences of our federal debt needed to be \n",
      "kept in mind or the high and rising federal debt that CBO \n",
      "projects over the next three decades would have serious \n",
      "consequences for the economy and federal budgeting, including \n",
      "the crowding out of private investment, higher interest costs, \n",
      "and increased risk of a fiscal crisis.\n",
      "    So, let's not fool ourselves. And most importantly, let's \n",
      "not fool those we represent, the American people. Blooming \n",
      "deficits and surging debt have been driven by and will continue \n",
      "to be driven by runaway profligate spending by the federal \n",
      "government, not because of any effects of climate change. That \n",
      "is a different thing. That's not what has caused our ballooning \n",
      "debt and deficit.\n",
      "    There has become an all to prevalent quality in American \n",
      "political discourse and specifically among many in the United \n",
      "States Senate and on the left who seek to climate alarmism to \n",
      "justify a widespread federal government takeover of our economy \n",
      "and a radical, unrealistic and damaging transition of our \n",
      "energy sector with all of its abruptness and all of its \n",
      "disregarding of things that have worked and helped elevate \n",
      "people out of poverty. And yes, even helped, in many instances, \n",
      "clean up the environment.\n",
      "    Dating back to at least the 1970s, a group of left-wing \n",
      "academics and media allies began making apocalyptic claims \n",
      "about climate change, stipulating that climate-related \n",
      "apocalyptic events would wipe out hundreds of millions if not \n",
      "billions of the Earth's human inhabitants over the next few \n",
      "decades. What's more concerning than the kooky theories of Paul \n",
      "Ehrlich or Thomas Malthus that a growing number of Democratic \n",
      "members of Congress, bureaucrats, and private sector business \n",
      "people are now making similarly outlandish and inflammatory \n",
      "alarmist claims about a looming climate apocalypse or at least \n",
      "throw support behind green new deal style legislative proposals \n",
      "and regulatory mandates.\n",
      "    Not only is this supremely misguided and shortsighted, but \n",
      "it's not remotely necessary. It certainly isn't desirable. The \n",
      "reality is that U.S. energy-related carbon emissions have been \n",
      "steadily declining over the last 15 years without any green new \n",
      "deal styled takeover of the federal budget and the American \n",
      "economy. And the same time China's carbon emissions have nearly \n",
      "doubled over that same time period.\n",
      "    Democrats in Congress and in the Biden Administration need \n",
      "to work with Republicans to promote American energy \n",
      "independence rather than promoting less efficient forms of \n",
      "energy, especially at a time of significant energy inflation. \n",
      "And it's been financially debilitating to low- and middle-\n",
      "income American households. And those energy costs translate \n",
      "also to higher food costs and higher costs for everything we \n",
      "buy and everything we do.\n",
      "    These costs don't fall on the wealthy like they fall on the \n",
      "poor and middle class. But brazen regulatory overreach \n",
      "currently being carried out by unelected and unaccountable \n",
      "bureaucrats must come to an end as those decisions of making \n",
      "law are expressly reserved for Congress under Article I, \n",
      "Sections 1 and 7 of the U.S. Constitution.\n",
      "    Lastly, it's my hope that this Committee will spend more of \n",
      "its time and effort this Congress deliberating ways to reduce \n",
      "our budget deficits so that we can stabilize our debt while \n",

      "the reason we're having this hearing and the reason that we're \n",
      "going to continue to have hearings on this subject is that $10 \n",
      "trillion of our federal debt can be ascribed to exogenous \n",
      "shocks to our economy with which we had to cope. It wasn't \n",
      "cheap, but we had to do it.\n",

      "many of which, as we've heard in this hearing, have support on \n",
      "both sides of the aisle.\n",
      "    I'll also add that I mentioned at the beginning of the \n",
      "hearing the prospect of healthcare reforms that can lower \n",
      "costs. Accountable care organizations were a perfect example of \n",
      "that and I look forward to working with members on both sides \n",
      "of the aisle and with CBO to drill into the cost bases for that \n",
      "and try to figure out we can do to do more of what looks like \n",
      "already trillions of dollars in healthcare savings that are \n",
      "projected from these changes.\n",
      "    But I'll close with a round of questioning. I didn't have \n",
      "the chance to ask Dr. Holtz-Eakin questions, so I'm going to \n",
      "yield myself a second round. And let me ask you, Dr. Holtz-\n",
      "Eakin, in preparing your testimony today did you familiarize \n",
      "yourself with the Bank of International Settlements so-called \n",
      "Green Swan Report, which warns of, and I quote, ``catastrophic \n",
      "and irreversible impacts from climate so large that''--and \n",
      "quoted them again--``it would make quantifying financial \n",
      "damages impossible?''\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. No, I did not read that report.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \n",
      "report put out in April of 2019 by dozens of central banks that \n",
      "says, ``Estimates of losses are large and range up to $20 \n",
      "trillion when looking at the economy more broadly.''\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I don't know that report.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \n",
      "Deloitte Global Turning Point Report, which concluded that in \n",
      "2070 alone global GDP could be 7.6 percent lower compared to a \n",
      "baseline that does not account for climate change.\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I read that report--scanned that report \n",
      "when it first came out.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \n",
      "report from economists largely centralized in Cambridge, but \n",
      "from around the world that said that the effect on the U.S. \n",
      "economy would be more than $3 trillion in losses and GDP could \n",
      "shrink by more than 5 percent due to the collapse of stranded \n",
      "assets?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I scanned that one as well when it came \n",
      "out.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \n",
      "report from Freddie Mac, the American mortgage giant that said, \n",
      "and I'm quoting here, that the economic losses and social \n",
      "disruption related to coastal property losses ``are likely to \n",
      "be greater in total than those experienced in the housing \n",
      "crisis and the Great Recession.''\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. No.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. I gather you did familiarize yourself \n",
      "with the CSTC Report that Litterman wrote. Correct?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. When it was released. Yes.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. And when it was released, its opening \n",
      "sentence was ``Climate change poses a major risk to the \n",
      "stability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to \n",
      "sustain the American economy,'' is that correct?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Yes.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. And the second paragraph after its \n",
      "header says, ``Risks include disorderly price adjustments in \n",
      "various assets classes with possible spillovers into different \n",
      "parts of the financial system as well as potential disruption \n",
      "of the proper functioning of financial markets.'' Not a good \n",
      "outcome, right?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Not desirable.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Not desirable indeed. And then it also \n",
      "said, ``A central finding of this report is that climate change \n",
      "could pose systemic risks to the U.S. financial system across \n",
      "multiple sectors, geographies, and assets in the United States, \n",
      "sometimes simultaneously, and within a relatively short \n",
      "timeframe.'' Do you recall it saying that?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Not specifically, but I believe that.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. And you wrote a little report on it in \n",
      "September of 2020 which noted that climate induced risks will \n",
      "cause dramatic financial fluctuations and the stability of the \n",
      "system will be at risk. And then on the backside of your one-\n",
      "pager, you said that the potential risks to financial markets \n",
      "posed by climate change represent a pervasive policy challenge. \n",
      "Have I quoted you correctly?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Yes.\n",

      "Litterman.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Yes. I would just say I am surprised, \n",
      "pleasantly surprised by the amount of agreement by certainly \n",
      "the witnesses here and the senators as well, and so I hope we \n",
      "can move forward. That's all.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Yes. I hope so too when I think that \n",
      "there are things that we can do. I think the key points coming \n",
      "out of this are that we've got to move forward globally. We \n",
      "can't pretend that we can build a fence around the United \n",
      "States, soft climate here and not be affected by what's going \n",
      "on in China and India and other places, Russia.\n",
      "    That we do have the tools to effect the behavior of China \n",
      "and India and other countries through carbon border tariffs, \n",
      "that they're already underway in the European Union. And that \n",
      "if we can pull together and be sensible about this we can take \n",
      "advantage of--I forget whether it was you, Dr. Litterman or Dr. \n",
      "Carney, who said negative risks, opportunities. That there is a \n",
      "huge upside to getting this right.\n",
      "    I'll close with the Deloitte number, which was that if we \n",
      "don't get this right it's $180 trillion in costs to the global \n",

       " \"OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN WHITEHOUSE \\\\1\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Prepared statement of Chairman Whitehouse appears in the \\nappendix on page 34.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. I am delighted to kick off the first \\nBudget Committee hearing of this year by welcoming Ranking \\nMember Grassley, who I serve with also on the Finance and \\nJudiciary Committees, so we have a lot of experience together \\nand I'm very happy that he's the Ranking Member.\\n    I want to welcome all the colleagues who will be in and out \\nof the hearing this morning. We have multiple hearings going on \\nand so you will be getting attendance sporadically from a \\nconsiderable number of our members. I want to particularly \\nwelcome our new members to what I hope will be a busy, revived, \\nimpactful, and lively Budget Committee.\\n    I want this to be your surprise favorite committee. We have \\nimportant work to do on bipartisan healthcare reforms, on \\nreforming this Committee's process to fit the basic arithmetic \\nof the budget and on issues important to each of you as \\nmembers.\\n    We're going to begin with a series of hearings on the \\nlooming costs and economic risks of climate upheaval. Almost \\nexactly five years ago, I sent around this binder to all of my \\nSenate colleagues in which I complied some of the compelling \\nwarnings about the economic risks associated with climate \\nchange.\\n    Last week I sent your staffs an updated version of the \\nbinder. Here it is. As you can see, the warnings keep piling \\nup. Have fun with the light reading. These warnings come from \\ncentral bankers, economists, assets managers, insurance \\ncompanies, investment banks, credit rating agencies, and \\nleading management consultations. Folks with a lot of \\ncredibility when it comes to economics, finance, corporate \\nrisks and their effects on government spending and revenues. \\nThese will be our witnesses, economists, scientists, business \\nleaders, and other financial and risk experts, many of whose \\nwork in this binder.\\n    I've said that science provides the headlights for society. \\nThat it's scientists who illuminate the way for us to navigate \\ninto the future. Think of the economists and scientists we'll \\nhear from as the headlights for the United States Congress as \\nthis Committee helps navigate our long-term budget and fiscal \\npriorities.\\n    Look at our national debt. One thing that stands is how \\nmuch of it was incurred as a result of exogenous shots to the \\neconomy. Consider the 2008 financial crisis which blew up the \\nfinancial security of families and businesses across the \\ncountry and reduced government revenues for a decade. Two years \\nafter the recession, CBO found that projected revenues fell by \\n$4.4 trillion and projected spending rose by $800 billion to \\nspur that recovery.\\n    Consider the pandemic. The Committee for a Responsible \\nFederal Budget estimates that the federal response to the \\npandemic which brought COVID under control, protected families, \\nand jumpstarted our economy recovery will add $5.5 trillion to \\nour deficits. That doesn't factor in lost revenue or lost \\neconomic activity, so the total economic cost is actually \\nhigher.\\n    We came through both. But together those two exogenous \\nshocks contributed $10 trillion to the federal debt, more than \\n40 percent of the total, proof of how catastrophic events can \\nand do effect the federal budget and the economy and how life \\nhas a way of upsetting best laid plans and 10-year budget \\nbaselines.\\n    Headlights and better attention to what they illuminated \\ncould've help. Plenty of financial experts saw the 2008 \\nmortgage mess coming. Plenty of epidemiologist warned that the \\ncountry was woefully unprepared for a pandemic.\\n    Now, we have all these warnings. Warnings of crashes in \\ncoastal property values as rising seas and more powerful storms \\nhit the 30-year mortgage horizon. Warnings of insurance \\ncollapse from more frequent, intense, and unpredictable \\nwildfires. A dangers interplay between the insurance and \\nmortgage markets hitting real estate markets across the \\ncountry.\\n    Inflation from decreased agricultural yields, massive \\ninfrastructure demand, trouble in municipal bond markets, \\nstranded assets, and a carbon bubble. The most dangerous risks \\nare called systemic. We mean that they will cascade out into \\nthe broader economy as the mortgage problem did in 2008, and \\nit's big. It predicts the differential between being \\nresponsible and reckless about climate could come to more $220 \\ntrillion, globally, between now and 2070.\\n    Some of these warn of risks are already upon us. Already \\nclimate-related national disasters increase federal spending on \\ndisaster assistance, flood insurance, crop insurance, and other \\nprograms we fund. But this is just the beginning. It will \\ncertainly get worse, much worse particularly if warming exceeds \\n1.5 degrees. We are on a bad trajectory. It's time for us all \\nto wake up and face the problem before coastal cities flood \\nwith water or southwest cities can't get water. I hope we can \\nfinish that off with action if we snap into focus on the \\ndanger.\\n    We're all familiar with the tragedy of the Commons. In \\n2015, our opening witness, Dr. Carney, gave a speech entitled \\nThe Tragedy of the Horizon because some of the gravest dangers \\nof climate change, which we could head off today, come to past \\nyears or decades out. Ryan's coastline will be gone, reshaped \\ninto an Acapulco by 2100.\\n    You say, ah, who cares? What's that? It's an eternity. \\nWell, almost exactly a year ago I became a grandfather for the \\nfirst time. Baby Vera, God willing, will be alive in 2100. When \\nI look at her, I'm looking at that future. Walk by any \\nelementary school, the faces you see on the playground, God \\nwilling, will be alive in 2100. How will those little ones \\nremember our less than greatest generation? We owe it to kids \\non playgrounds all across America to pay attention to get this \\nright.\\n    By the end of this series of hearings, if we hear these \\nexpert witnesses, if we treat their testimony as our \\nheadlights, then our path, I hope, will be clear. Thank you and \\nlet's get to work.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. I turn to my Ranking Member, Senator \\nGrassley.\",\n",
       " \"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR GRASSLEY \\\\2\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Prepared statement of Senator Grassley appears in the appendix \\non page 36.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Senator Grassley. Senator Whitehouse, I compliment you on \\nyour leadership on this Committee and look forward to the two \\nyears ahead. I'm pleased to be here with all of you as Ranking \\nMember. Despite our political differences, and they aren't as \\ngreat as the public believes between Republicans and the \\nDemocrats, and particularly between Grassley and Whitehouse. I \\nknow that we can find common areas of agreement to work on \\ntogether.\\n    One area of agreement must be that our budget and \\nappropriation process is broken. This sentiment isn't new at \\nall nor is it particularly partisan. No person could look at \\nlast year's process and say that things are working. For Fiscal \\nYear 2023, Congress didn't adopt a budget. The Senate \\nAppropriations Committee didn't mark up a single bill and not \\none of the 12 individual appropriation bills was debated in the \\nSenate floor.\\n    Instead, we were presented with a $1.7 trillion omnibus \\njust a few days before Congress. Things need to change. Now, \\nmaybe we shouldn't be surprised because when the Senate goes \\ninto session at 3 o'clock on Monday and has one vote, hardly \\nany business, and then you work all day Tuesday and all day \\nWednesday and adjourn at 1:45 on Thursday, you can't get a lot \\nof session work done when you are just in session two and a \\nhalf weeks compared to when I came to the United States Senate \\nstarted no later than noon on Monday, debated on Monday, \\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, went home Friday at 4:00. So, I \\nthink there needs to be some reanalysis of the work that we're \\nputting--I mean not the work because there's plenty of work for \\nsenators, but the amount of time that we're in session.\\n    I want to applaud two leaders in this process, Senator \\nMurray and Collins, for publicly announcing their commitment to \\nregular order, including debating appropriation bills on the \\nSenate floor. We need to do our part to make that happen. We \\nshould also agree that our nation's fiscal outlook is dire.\\n    The Congressional Budget Office will release an updated \\nbudget projection this afternoon. Every indication is that \\ntheir new projections will be as bad as or worse than last \\nsummer's projection. This is what they told us last summer. \\nWithin 10 years, public debt, as a share of our economy, will \\nexceed World War II record highs. However, unlike after World \\nWar II, when spending and debt subsided, our public debt is \\nprojected to climb even higher.\\n    Our public debt will reach 110 percent of our economy in \\n2032 and grow to 185 percent by 2052. Trillion-dollar annual \\ndeficits will be replaced by two trillion deficits within a few \\nyears. Simply serving the debt will lead record-breaking annual \\ncosts of more than $1 trillion within 10 years.\\n    So, Mr. Chairman, your immediate predecessor refused to \\nbring in CBO to discuss the overall budget outlook. This was a \\nmistake. So, I urge under your leadership to hold a hearing \\nwith CBO on the latest outlook. Nobody benefits from just \\nburying our heads in the sand. I acknowledge that a changing \\nclimate is a historic and scientific fact. I also recognize \\nthat most scientists agree man-made emissions contribute to \\nclimate change.\\n    Throughout my career, I've advocated for renewable and \\nalternative energy solutions. Being the father of the Wind \\nEnergy Tax Credit in 1992, I think maybe I was doing that 10 \\nyears before climate change was much of an issue. And so, today \\nin Iowa we get 60 percent of our electricity from wind and in \\nfour years American Energy, Des Moines, Iowa, will be getting \\n80 percent, 85 percent maybe more accurately, of their energy \\nfrom wind.\\n    This being said, even if the entire U.S. stopped emitting \\ngreenhouse gas tomorrow, projected temperatures would only be \\nthree-tenths degrees Fahrenheit lower come 2100. Even in this \\nunrealistic scenario, the U.S. would still need major polluters \\nlike China and India to pull their weight. As we look to \\naddress climate and energy issues, the nation must also address \\nour fiscal health.\\n    There's plenty of blame to go around for how we got into \\nour current situation. Republican or Democrats have to share \\nthis blame. For decades, Congress turned a blind eye as our \\nnation walked toward a fiscal cliff, but Democrats turned that \\nwalk into a sprint. In March 2021, Democrats to advantage an \\nemergency situation to pass a $2 trillion partisan spending \\nbill, even as our economy showed strong signs of recovery. Then \\nas inflation started to a 40-year high, they doubled down \\nspending trillions more on their liberal wish list.\\n    They pushed through omnibus appropriation bills with take \\nit or leave mantra for two years. Each time growing the size of \\nthe government when not using fast-track procedures or \\ngovernment shutdown as leverage, the Administration drove \\ndeficits through unilateral action like long giveaways that \\ncould cost taxpayers a trillion dollars.\\n    Congress needs then, it's very obvious, a fiscal reality \\ncheck. And I know our Chairman is trying to bring that fiscal \\nreality check by bringing up all of the issues that climate \\nchange is going to add to the budget and that's the correct \\nthing to do. But this reality check has to start with this \\nCommittee getting back to performing core functions.\\n    This includes holding hearings on federal fiscal matters, \\nexamining programs and authorizations that have been on \\nautopilot for decades and performing robust oversight of agency \\nspending. No government entity should be exempt.\\n    Now finally, I welcome the opportunity to work with you, \\nSenator Whitehouse, on budget process reform. You are a well-\\nestablished leader on this issue. I appreciate your stated \\ninterest in working with the rest of us on this issue starting, \\nand I'll be ready to join you anytime, from where we left off \\nwith Senator Enzi in 2019. It was bipartisan process then and I \\nthink we can build to get it over the finish line with this \\nCongress.\\n    Needless to say, we have our work cut out for us to get our \\nfiscal house in order. To paraphrase former fed chairman Paul \\nVolcker, cutting spending may be painful, but the pain for all \\nof us will be much greater if it isn't accomplished. So, I look \\nforward to our work over the next two years.\\n    Thank you and let's get to work.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Grassley, so do I. \\nAnd I mentioned the budget process reform in my opening remarks \\nfor a reason. I look forward to working on that and think \\nthere's plenty of blame to go around for where we are in terms \\nof the deficit, but having a Budget Committee that actually \\nlooks at the elements of that in an arthritically correct way \\nis a very, very good start.\\n    I am pleased to have three very distinguished witnesses \\nhere to testify before us today. Joining us remotely is Dr. \\nMark Carney, the former Governor of the Bank of Canada and the \\nBank of England. For those not familiar with that role, that's \\neffectively the CEO. Dr. Carney is a world renown central \\nbanker and has long been sounding the alarm about the economic \\nrisks posed by climate change.\\n    Following Dr. Carey's testimony we'll hear from Dr. Bob \\nLitterman, who chaired the Commodity Futures Trading \\nCommission's Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee, which in \\n2020 issued an authoritative report on this subject.\\n    Following Dr. Litterman, we will hear from Dr. Douglas \\nHoltz-Eakin, former Director of the Congressional Budget Office \\nand President of the American Action Forum. I note that back in \\n2003 CBO prepared a report on the economics of climate change \\nunder Dr. Holtz-Eakin's leadership.\\n    Dr. Carney, if we have you here remotely, please take five \\nminutes to deliver your remarks. Your prepared remarks are in \\nthe record of the proceeding.\",\n",
       " \"STATEMENT OF DR. MARK CARNEY, FORMER GOVERNOR, BANKS OF ENGLAND \\n                         AND CANADA \\\\3\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\3\\\\ Prepared statement of Dr. Carney appears in the appendix on \\npage 38.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Dr. Carney. Thank you very much, Chairman Whitehouse, \\nRanking Member Grassley, members of the Committee for the honor \\nof this invitation to address the risks and economic costs of \\nclimate change.\\n    During my terms as Governor of the Bank of England and as \\nChair of the Financial Stability Board, I headed committees \\nwith responsibility for understanding and addressing the \\nprincipal risk to financial stability. Risks such as the Chair \\nreferred to in his opening comments.\\n    About a decade ago, these bodies became increasing \\nconcerned about the rising economic risk from climate change \\nand the fact that the financial system lacked the information, \\nthe tools, and the markets to manage them. So, over the \\nfollowing years a wide range of regulatory authorities and \\nprivate financial institutions had worked to develop the \\nbuilding blocks of a financial system that can manage these \\nrisks on behalf of their depositors, pensioners, clients, and \\nshareholders.\\n    But while the pace of change has picked up, it's not yet \\nequal to the scale of the challenge. Due to the undiversifiable \\nnature of climate risks, governments will bear many of the \\ncosts of extreme weather and of adaptation. And moreover, the \\nlonger adjustment is delayed the greater the impact will be on \\nfinancial stability, inflation, jobs, and growth.\\n    Diversely, transitioning to a low-carbon economy will \\nreduce the impact of climate change, create jobs of the future, \\nand promote a resilient financial system. I won't read it into \\nthe record the fact that the fiscal impacts of climate change \\nare rising. I've reference in my testimony of the data \\ncollected by the EPA, the\",\n",
       " \"NRAA, NASA, amongst others, that \\nprovides a snapshot of how it's already impacting the United \\nStates.\\n    Climate change is having an increased impact on Americans. \\nAdjusted for inflation, the number of billion dollar disasters \\nhas risen sixfold from the first half of the 1980s to an \\naverage of 18 per year over the past five years. Annual \\ninflation adjusted cost of these disasters has risen seven \\ntimes from $18 billion to $120 billion.\\n    Increased flooding and coastal erosion are causing \\nsignificant damage already. Increases in weather-related \\ndisasters have lead to insurance becoming less available, more \\nexpensive for American families and businesses. Extreme weather \\nis reducing incomes for farmers and raising food costs for \\nfamilies and the increased frequency and intensity of flooding \\nand disasters disrupts and damages critical infrastructure, and \\nin turn, supply chains hurting American businesses and raising \\ncosts again for American families.\\n    There is ample scientific evidence that these trends are \\nexpected to worsen as each additional fraction of degree \\nwarming means more frequent and intense hurricanes, coastal \\nfloodings, heatwaves, and wildfires. Estimates suggest that \\nover the balance of this century climate change could reduce \\nthe level of global GDP per capita by between 10 to 20 percent \\nwithout further efforts to limit warming. Similar estimates \\nhave been found for the United States.\\n    As economically significant as these estimates are, it's \\ninstructive to examine what's not included in them, both assets \\noutside of the market economy, such as biodiversity and human \\nhealth, as well as critical economic channels, including \\ndisrupted supply chains, risk to monitoring and financial \\nstability, and economic impacts of rising risks to the national \\nsecurity.\\n    As temperatures increase and extreme weather events worsen, \\nthe cost to governments will increase further. Ultimately, \\ngovernments--state, local and federal--will better cost the \\nprivate households and businesses and markets are unable to \\nshoulder, including meeting emergency needs, financing disaster \\nrecovery, and building resilience to future extreme weather.\\n    To conclude, the costs to property, agriculture, and \\nlivelihoods are already high and expected to grow materially. \\nThe hit to GDP growth from unmitigated climate change is \\nexpected to be significant and many of the most severe impacts \\nto human health, to livelihoods, to natural heritage, are not \\nincluded in these calculations.\\n    But there's one final risk from climate change, a negative \\nrisk, better known as an opportunity. Increased recognition of \\nthe risks of climate change is no galvanizing efforts to \\naddress the issue. Last year over a trillion dollars was \\ninvested in the energy transition, representing over 1 percent \\nof global GDP and those investments are expected to rise \\nsignificantly, creating more jobs and higher incomes.\\n    In short, while ignoring climate change will lead to \\nsignificant costs, climate solutions are becoming one of the \\ngreatest commercial opportunities of our time. Thank you for \\nyour attention. I'll be pleased to answer your questions.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks, Dr. Carney. We turn now to Dr. \\nLitterman.\",\n",

Thank you, Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking \\nMember Grassley, and members of the Committee. Thank you for \\ninviting me to address the economic risks associated with \\nclimate change and the tremendous cost they may impose on \\nAmericans.\\n    This summer I visited Greenland to study the melting of the \\nice sheet. The icebergs calving from the glaciers are \\nbeautiful, but they represent the very beginning of what sadly, \\nwill be an inevitable acceleration of sea level rise, the \\ntiming of which, however, is both highly uncertain and depends \\ncritically on the actions that we take today.\\n    I want to focus your attention on time because time is a \\nscarce resource in managing risks. Climate change is a long-\\nterm global risk management failure, but it must be addressed \\nimmediately because we don't know how much time we have. The \\nUnited States has an urgent responsibility to do much more than \\nit has to date. Our grandchildren face grave danger.\\n    Global sea level rise in this century, for example, is \\nestimated to be between 2 and up to 10 feet, depending \\nprimarily on how quickly we reduce our emissions.\\n    Before I go any further, I'd like to tell you a little bit \\nabout my background as much of my work is highly relevant to \\ntoday's subject. I am an economist by training and have spent \\nmy career managing financial risks. I worked at Goldman Sachs \\nfor 23 years. I was a partner and head of the firm Wide Risk \\nDepartment.\\n    I now sit on several boards for groups that study and \\npropose responses to climate risks, including the Climate \\nLeadership Council and the Niskanen Center. No doubt, the \\nreason I am here today is because in 2020 I chaired the CFTC \\nClimate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee, which published a \\nunanimous and widely cited report, Managing Climate Risk in the \\nU.S. Financial System. We had environmental organizations, such \\nas the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund, \\nbut also Agri business companies like Cargill and Bunge. Oil \\nand gas companies like Conoco Phillips and BP, and banks like \\nMorgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Citi.\\n    There was no collection of wide-eyed environmental \\nactivists nor were politics involved. This was a rigorous \\nreport with dozens of recommendations from hard-headed experts \\nand we came to the unanimous conclusion that climate change \\nposes significant risks to the American economy that must be \\naddressed urgently.\\n    In the Agricultural sector, for example, we found that \\nclimate change is likely to significantly reduce crop yields, \\ndecrease labor productivity, degrade soil and water quality, \\nincrease the range and virulence of pests and disrupt supply \\nchains. Climate change will also impose large costs on \\ncompanies and governments.\\n    One example, the CFTC Report, highlighted with the case of \\nPacific Gas and Electric in California which entered bankruptcy \\nbecause of $30 billion in liabilities associated with its \\ninfrastructure, sparking record wildfires. Extreme weather \\nimpacts are already here and are growing rapidly, including \\nheatwaves, floods, hurricanes, drought, and wildfires.\\n    Meanwhile, the effects of climate change loom every larger \\nin the future. Losses from billion-dollar extreme weather \\nevents totaled $165 billion last year. And while it varies from \\nyear to year, the costs from climate change are clearly growing \\nrapidly. Extreme weather events are becoming more common as the \\natmosphere warms. Terms such as the 100-Year Flood are used to \\ndescribe the magnitude of an event that has happened \\nhistorically on average once every hundred years. That happens \\nto be an important frequency.\\n    We build infrastructure to withstand events that happen on \\na regular basis and so the damage created by weather that \\nhappens regularly is small. But when a 100-year event occurs, \\nthe magnitude is so large that we're not prepared and it \\ntypically leads to complete destruction of property. The \\nproblem is that while such a term continues to describe the \\nmagnitude of extreme weather events the frequency of occurrence \\ntoday tends to be much higher.\\n    Declining real estate values driven by climate-related \\nimpacts or the expectation of such impacts in the future could \\nsubstantially depress regional economic activity in exposed \\nareas. Climate change will also likely inflict large costs on \\nhuman health and its impacts will fall hardest on those with \\nfewer resources, increasing inequity.\\n    There are also a number of risks related to crossing a \\ntipping point. A tipping point is a nonlinearity in the \\nresponse of a system and there are a number of warning \\npotential tipping points in the climatic system. More worrying \\nstill, recent scientific research suggests that we may cross \\nseveral of these tipping points with even only at 1.5 degree of \\nwarming it may cross several additional ones with 2 degrees of \\nwarming.\\n    While the subject of this hearing is the economic risks and \\ncosts associated with climate change, I would be remiss if I \\ndid not mention one last thing. All of the research and \\nanalysis on this subject agrees that the sooner we act to \\nreduce emissions the lower will be the expected costs and risks \\nwe incur.\\n    In addition, a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy \\nwill, by removing policy uncertainty, likely actually result in \\nsubstantial investment and increased economic growth.\\n    I have lots of ideas on this subject, but the bottom line \\nis that with global average temperatures already having risen \\nover 1 degree C and with potentially catastrophic tipping \\npoints on the horizon, risk management demands an immediate \\nresponse leading to globally harmonized incentives to reduce \\nemissions.\\n    There are immediate steps that this Congress can take to \\nmove this process forward and I would welcome the opportunity \\nto discuss the policies you might pursue to help the risk to \\nthe economy and ensure that prices reflect the actual costs \\nassociated with production of goods, including the damages \\ncreated by carbon emissions. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. We look forward to taking you up on \\nthat offer, Dr. Litterman and turn to Dr. Holtz-Eakin.\",\n",
       " 'STATEMENT OF DR. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-',\n",
       " \"EAKIN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN \\n                        ACTION FORUM \\\\5\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\5\\\\ Prepared statement of Dr. Holtz-Eakin appears in the appendix \\non page 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eaken. Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member \\nGrassley, and members of the Committee, thank you for the \\nprivilege of being here today. Let me make three points quickly \\nand then I look forward to the chance to answer your questions.\\n    The first point is that climate change will have real \\nimpacts on the U.S. economy and these will worsen the federal \\nbudget outlook. Unquestionably, there will be additional \\noutlays from the national flood insurance programs and other \\ndisaster crop risks kinds of programs and mandatory outlays. \\nThe Congress will probably chose to make some discretionary \\noutlays in the future in response to the needs for mitigation \\nand/or adaptation and these will worsen the budget picture, but \\nthe biggest impact is going to be lower revenue from an economy \\nthat grows more slowly over the long term and that the loss of \\nsome capital assets, diminished labor productivity, diminished \\nproductivity in agricultural lands will cumulatively reduce \\ninflows to the federal budget.\\n    The Congressional Budget Office recently took a look at \\nthis issue and concluded that the center point of set of \\nestimates for the impact would be about a percentage point \\nlower in GDP by 2051. And I would just point out that while \\nthat's a significant impact it's tantamount to under a tenth of \\na percentage point slower growth each and every year.\\n    In contrast, and this point number two, the federal budget \\npresents an immediate and much larger economic threat. We \\nalready have debt to GEP in the range of 100 percent and \\nthere's a large literature that stems from the work of Ken \\nRogoff and Carmen Reinhart indicates that countries in that \\nrange experience slower growth on the order of a percentage \\npoint per year because of their debt burdens. And the U.S. not \\nonly has entered that range it has a budget outlook which is \\nunsustainable.\\n    The CBO will put out a revised Economic and Budget Outlook \\nthis afternoon at 2 o'clock. It will doubtlessly look like the \\none they put out last year that shows spending expending \\nrevenues as far as the eye can see, driven by very rapid growth \\nin the outlays in Medicare at 7 percent a year, Social Security \\nat 6 percent a year, faster than any revenue source could \\npossibly grow and as a result it will show debt relative to GDP \\nrising as far as the eye can see. The interest costs of \\ncarrying that debt rising as far as can see and that is a \\nmechanism which is a guarantee for slower growth in the future.\\n    The point of the borrowing is not just the debt. The point \\nis that that brings resources from the private sector into the \\ngovernment sector. And for every dollar you take from private \\ninvestment and put into the best of federal infrastructure \\ninvestments, you lose about 50 percent of the rate of return, \\nso you're losing on every one of those borrowing activities, \\ndiminishing the productivity in the economy, lowering the \\nstandard of living for future workers in the next generations.\\n    We really don't spend a lot of money on investments in this \\nprogram and more than likely we're going to take that money \\nfrom a private investment and put it into a consumption \\nexpenditure. That's the point of Social Security and Medicare \\nis to raise the standard of living in retirement for seniors. \\nThere's no rate of return to consumption investment, so the \\nfederal budget is the biggest headwind to economic growth \\nbecause it is stacked against investing in the future and needs \\nto be brought into some sort sustainable alignment in order to \\nstop these headwinds to growth.\\n    The other point that's going on in the federal budget is \\nthat the mandatory expenditures are crowding out discretionary \\nspending. Discretionary spending is where we do national \\nsecurity, basic research, infrastructure, education, all the \\nplaces where you can invest in the future of the country and \\nthose opportunities are getting squeezed out by the growth of \\nthese mandatory programs.\\n    So, point number three, not only would getting the budget \\non a sustainable trajectory improve the economic outlook, it \\nwould free up the budget resources through investments, \\nespecially investments in the climate mitigation and adaptation \\nthat are so important to this Committee and to this hearing.\\n    And so, I can't think of a single bigger accomplishment \\nthan for this Committee and the U.S. Congress to finally come \\nto grips with the federal budget outlook and its \\nunsustainability. It lies at the crossroads of all the threats \\nto our future and needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.\\n    I thank you for the chance to be here today. I look forward \\nto your questions.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I'll lead \\nand then Senator Romney is next in line.\\n    Dr. Carney, you've held two of the most significant and \\npowerful positions global in the banking sector. Climate change \\nwas not customarily a part of the banking sector's interest. \\nWhy is it that you took such an interest I addressing climate \\nchange?\\n    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Chair. It goes back, in part, to \\nyour opening comments, some of the points you made in your \\nopening comments, which is that under-investing in resilience \\nupfront leads to much greater costs down the road. And it was \\nparticular when I became Governor at the Bank of England and \\nit's not commonly known, but one of the responsibilities of the \\nBank of England is to oversee the insurance industry and it's \\nthe fourth largest insurance industry in the world. It includes \\none of the largest, if not the largest, re-insurance market, \\nthe famous Lords of London, and so therefore that's a property \\nin casualty and re-insurance industry that's directly affected \\nby climate change.\\n    And one of the lessons that the brokers and the risk \\nmanagers in Lord of London had determined was that the tail \\nrisk of the past were becoming the central scenario of the \\nfuture. I'll refer to Dr. Litterman's comments about one in a \\nhundred risk events becoming that much more frequent. So, of \\ncourse they're adjusting pricing. They're adjusting coverage \\nwhich as real implications for economies and it's apparent to \\nus, as risk managers, that this will affect the economy more \\nbroadly and the financial system potentially more broadly if \\nthere is not adequate information to assess the potential \\ndegree of those risks. And if risk managers don't at least have \\nthe opportunity to determine whether or not they will take \\nsteps----\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Carney, you were in charge of the \\nBank of Canada after the 2008 financial crisis. Can you compare \\nwhat you foresee with respect to climate with what you \\nexperienced in the 2008 mortgage crisis?\\n    Dr. Carney. Well, there's two things that I would say. The \\nfirst is that one of the experiences of that crisis, and many \\nof the members, of course, lived through it and helped managed \\nthrough it, is what's called a Minsky moment, a realization \\nthat basic assumptions were no longer true. For example, that \\nhealth prices would never fall in the United States, that \\ncapital was money good, that assets off balance sheets would \\nstay off balance sheets, all of those proved false and lead to \\nthe collapse or virtual collapse of the core, much of the core \\nof the financial system with huge economic costs that \\nultimately have added to the debt burden of the United States, \\namongst other countries.\\n    Now, in Canada, we were more fortunate for a variety of \\nreasons, but one of the reasons was we had put more resilience \\ninto our financial institutions upfront.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. I'm not getting into Canada \\nspecifically. I'm looking between what you project potentially \\nhappening with the climate crisis. What's the scale comparison, \\nin your mind, between what we experienced with the 2008 \\nfinancial crisis and what climate portends for our systems?\\n    Dr. Carney. Okay, so I'll just lead from that point. The \\nfirst point is what we want to avoid is a rapid and sudden \\nadjustment to the climate crisis, both adaptation, the impact \\nof fiscal damage or belated investments to address the issue. \\nThe orders of magnitude are potentially similar in those cases \\nif we delay adjustment.\\n    If we adjust upfront, actually, I'm of the view that we can \\nactually grow economies through the investments which would \\nimprove competitiveness. But if we delay it until it's evident, \\nand this is the tragedy of the horizon supremely evident to \\neverybody, then the orders of magnitude approaches the \\nfinancial crisis.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. And just to be clear, your testimony \\nis that climate change could reduce the level of global GDP per \\ncapita by 10 to 20 percent and in that calculation you leave \\nout critical economic channels that have not been modeled, \\nincluding disrupted supply chains, challenges to monetary and \\nfinancial stability that increasing climate change will \\npresent, and potential economic impact of rising risks to \\nnational security; is that a fair summary?\\n    Dr. Carney. That is a fair summary. And one of the lessons \\nof large shocks is they get amplified as they come through the \\nfinancial sector. Yes.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Litterman, the papers we have in \\nfront of us are littered with the ``systemic risk.'' It seems \\nlike a mild little term. Could you give us a sense of what its \\nimpact is?\\n    Dr. Litterman. The system risk that's incorporated in \\nclimate change comes from the uncertainty about how the economy \\nis going to be responding to the various different hazards that \\nare increasing. So, we have whole areas of the country that may \\nbe impacted by extreme weather, Florida, for instance, that \\ncould lead to significant financial stress in terms of the \\nability to raise funds for capital. So, you can have \\nsignificant systemic impacts on the economy. It's ones of those \\nthings we just don't know.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. You said cascade through the economy.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Excuse me?\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Systemic meaning it cascades through \\nthe economy and the sectors.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Exactly. It will affect every aspect of the \\neconomy, including government budgets.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. And last question, you said you were \\nhard-headed about your report. Explain?\\n    Dr. Litterman. Yes, this is a report that was created by a \\nbunch of scientists, academics, business people, investor, and \\nwe came to unanimous agreement. It wasn't about, I don't know, \\ngut feeling. It was about facts. And the problem is we don't \\nknow what the future is going to bring, so we have to be \\nprepared. It's very simple.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Good word to end on. I think my clock \\nstarted a little bit late, so if the Ranking Member would like \\nto go a little bit beyond that would be--all's fair. And I turn \\nto Senator Grassley, Senator Padilla next, Senator Romney next, \\nunless Senator Marshall returns.\\n    Senator Grassley. Dr. Holtz-Eakin, our rising deficits are \\ncast by a lot of people as long-term challenge, ``long-term \\nchallenge.'' Something we will have to deal with in the future, \\nbut not immediate problem today. Is that really the case or are \\nwe already living with the consequences of reckless spending \\nand borrowing?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, I certainly believe the impacts are \\nimmediate and shouldn't be put off. Most people characterize \\nthe threat as something that looks like, you know, a Greece, \\nPortugal sovereign meltdown that would happen somewhere in the \\nfuture if we just did nothing, but the reality is that the \\nmechanism I described in my opening remarks, the diminished \\nproductivity, the headwinds to raising the standard of living \\nare going on in small amounts every single year.\\n    It might be too tiny to notice in the moment, but \\ncumulatively there are an enormous impact on our progress and \\nso I think it's something that needs to be rectified \\nimmediately, both in and of itself, but also because it would \\nallow the Congress more flexibility in pursuing other policy \\nobjectives.\\n    Senator Grassley. Also to you, in last week's State of the \\nUnion address, the President once again tried to portray \\nhimself as deficit reducer. He pointed to last year's $1.4 \\ntrillion deficit, which was lower than the 2002 deficits due to \\ncessation by bipartisan pandemic relief. So, to you how would \\nyou rate the President's budgetary performance so far?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I think the Administration has done \\nnothing to improve the budgetary outlook. Certainly, if you \\nlook back at 2021, the American Rescue Plan was an enormous \\npolicy error. Something I said at the time, so it's not 20/20 \\nhindsight. It was a two trillion dollar stimulus in an economy \\nthat was growing at 6 percent. I was too big, was unnecessary, \\nwas poorly designed, lead to a lot of inflation, and this has \\nbeen followed by several proposals called Build Back Better, \\nbut did not add up in any meaningful way and would have added \\nto the core structural deficit in the United States.\\n    He's taken administrative actions for hundreds of billions \\nof dollars in student loan relief that are difficult for me to \\ndefend, so I don't see any activities being taken by the \\nAdministration that are recognizing the problems that federal \\nbudget faces and we need some leadership on that front.\\n    Senator Grassley. Dr. Carney, in last week's State of the \\nUnion address, President Biden admitted that the U.S. will need \\noil and gas ``for a while.'' Your firm, Brookfield Asset \\nManagement, has invested in oil and gas infrastructure around \\nthe world. Do you believe that the U.S. Government should \\nmandate private institutions divest from their fossil fuel \\ninterests, and if so, what immediate impact would this have on \\nthe average American?\\n    Dr. Carney. The first thing, I agree with the President and \\nthe timeline in continued need for fossil fuel. Secondly, I'll \\njust note Brookfield is one of the largest investors in \\nrenewables and operators of renewables in the world. Thirdly, \\nno, I don't believe and I've never advocated mandatory \\ndivestment of fossil fuels assets. In fact, to address the \\nclimate challenge what is necessary to get capital financing to \\nwhere the emissions are and ensure that businesses can invest \\nto get those emissions down and that's been a consistent \\nposition I've had for more than a decade.\\n    Senator Grassley. Yes. I don't have a question, but you \\nsaid--even though I have 1 and 12 seconds left, I'd like to \\njust make a statement, but it's kind of a question for \\ninformation from Dr. Litterman and Dr. Carney and it deals with \\nthe ESG movements within finance, within banking. And I know \\nyou don't have to invest where you don't want to invest, but as \\na family farmer in Iowa and my son, Robin, runs the family \\nfarm, but we're corn/soybean farmers.\\n    So, let's just assume that the FDIC or some other regulator \\nor bank say to the community bank in Parkersburg, Iowa that \\nyou've got to make sure that you know what the carbon footprint \\nis of the farmer and in 60 years of arming I don't know where \\nto start to answer that question. And then I think--so what is \\nobligation that banker is under an obligation to get that \\ninformation from me, but if the farmer can't give the \\ninformation how does it get out? So this is what I'm thinking \\nas a historic farming. When I started farming in 1960, we'd \\nmake 10 trips across the field and produce maybe 60 bushel of \\ncorn to the acre.\\n    Today with minimum tillage or no tillage, we make about \\nthree or four trips across and we produce--in Iowa, I think the \\naverage farmer produced 204 bushels of corn to acre. So, you \\ncan see that farmers are already producing unit of food with a \\nlot less units of energy than they used to and do we get any \\ncredit for that? I mean we've already been helping the global \\nwarming issue with more efficient farming and all that. But \\nthat banker in Parkersburg can say to Chuck Grassley you tell \\nus what your carbon footprint is.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Senator, it's not an issue of reporting what \\nyour carbon footprint is. We don't have to be aware of what the \\ncarbon flux out of the atmosphere into the ground is and \\nthere's tremendous opportunity for farmers to actually address \\nthis problem, to sequester carbon into their soil so they can \\nchange the way they farm. But we do have to address the \\nproblem. We have to measure the carbon. We have to understand \\nthe science. There's a tremendous opportunity in farming, in \\nranching, and in timberlands to address this problem and I hope \\nwe do.\\n    Senator Grassley. Well, what'd you think we been doing? We \\nhave been using midland tillage for 25 years, no till for \\nprobably about that long.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Well, sadly, the farmers have not been \\ncompensated for the things that they have done to sequester \\ncarbon into the soil. They are compensated for being more \\nefficient, but we haven't recognized carbon. Carbon movement \\ninto and out of the atmosphere is something that we need to be \\naware of. We need to measure it and we need to create \\nincentives. We all understand this. We need to creative \\nincentives to reduce emissions. Let's just do it.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. The Growing Climate Solutions Act is \\nan example to help farmers do that, which passed with big \\nbipartisan numbers. Senator Padilla, and then I had the order \\nwrong. Next is Senator Marshall.\",\n",
       " \"STATEMENT OF SENATOR PADILLA\\n\\n    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Communities of \\nColor, Indigenous Communities, Low-Income Communities, and \\nImmigrant Communities are more likely to be located in climate-\\nrisk prone areas and areas with degraded infrastructure, making \\nthem even more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\\n    It was one of the many reasons I was proud to support the \\nInflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law \\nlast Congress which are making critical investments to combat \\nthe climate crisis. And notably, these laws direct resources \\ntowards many of the underserved and frontline communities that \\nI just referenced, which far too often bear the brunt of the \\ncrisis and other natural disasters.\\n    First question is for Dr. Carney. Can you talk about how \\nthe climate crisis disproportionately impacts these already \\nmarginalized communities and the importance of equity in our \\nfinancial response and investments?\\n    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Senator, for the question. Yes, it \\nis an unfortunate reality that climate change has these \\nimpacts, in part, through--well, through the direct areas in \\nwhich many disadvantaged communities live, proximity, for \\nexample, to our coasts and of course this Committee will know \\nthat 40 percent of Americans are living within \\\\1/8\\\\ of a mile \\nof coasts and coasts which potentially are subject to, on some \\nestimates, half a trillion of property damage over the balance \\nof this century.\\n    Secondly, to the extent to which more extreme weather \\nconditions leads to great volatility in food prices, energy \\ncosts, that will also be a direct impact to these disadvantaged \\ngroups. And then, thirdly, one of the issues that we all are \\ngoing to be facing around the world, but certainly in America \\nas well, businesses and families feasibility to get insurance \\ncoverage. As these impacts become more prominent, the ability \\nto afford it, if it is available, and of course, so for \\nfamilies, and I'll finish with this, that are already \\nvulnerable to not have the protection the insurance industry \\ncan provide because of just the risk, the greater risks that \\nhave become central scenarios, if you will, that adds to the \\nvulnerability.\\n    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Dr. Carney. Appreciate you \\nraising the issue of insurance coverage. We're working with the \\nWhite House on an initiative in that regard, so I look forward \\nto following up with you. But on the same broad theme, for far \\ntoo long it's the disadvantaged communities that I'm talking \\nabout that have also been underserved or face barriers when it \\ncomes to accessing financial services.\\n    Unfortunately, as Dr. Litterman wrote in his testimony, \\ncertain sectors of our economy are more susceptible to the sub-\\nsystemic risks of climate change. This includes community and \\nregional financial institutions, given they typically serve \\ngeographically concentrated areas and can suffer potentially \\nsignificant losses due to natural disasters and extreme weather \\nevents.\\n    So, given that these institutions serve a vital function in \\nproviding financial access to low-income individuals and \\nmarginalized communities, the risk is even more concerning. Dr. \\nLitterman, can you discuss the risk of these climate-fueled \\nsub-systemic shocks to local and regional economies and \\ndescribe how they could disproportionally impact these \\ncommunities?\\n    Dr. Litterman. Sure. Well, wealthy communities will be able \\nto build their infrastructure, harden their infrastructure and \\nbe prepared. I live in California and we see smoke more often \\nnow. Well, if I put a HEPA filter in and I can filter my air \\nI'm better off, but not everyone can afford that.\\n    People who can't afford to address some of these risks that \\nare coming, whether it's drought, smoke, heatwaves, and so on, \\nif they can't air condition their homes, they're going to be \\nsuffering. And we see that around the world when exposed people \\nare impacted by these hazards it's the poor that suffer the \\nmost. So, it's absolutely just one more example of where we \\nhave inequity and we're not paying attention to it.\\n    Senator Padilla. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Marshall, followed by Senator \\nVan Hollen, and then Senator Romney.\",\n",
       " \"STATEMENT OF SENATOR MARSHALL\\n\\n    Senator Marshall. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'm \\nhonored to be here on the Budget Committee with you. I just \\nwant to commit to you and my friends across the aisle is that \\nI'm as committed as anybody is to leaving this world cleaner, \\nhealthier, and safer than we found it. That as a fifth-\\ngeneration farm kid that means that my family has been \\nstewarding the land for five generations. That the soil at our \\nfarm is in better shape today than it was five generations ago.\\n    But we've done things like no-till farming like Senator \\nGrassley mentioned since 1991. That we planted 20,000 trees. \\nThat we have fenced off creeks, we call them creeks in Rhode \\nIsland, Chairman, but whatever it is, creeks back home that \\nflow into wildlife refuges. We've created wetland habitat.\\n    Precision agriculture is exploding in Kansas, that we're \\ngrowing more with less, that we're reusing water, that we're \\ntaking the fat from the packing plants and turning into \\nrenewable diesel. My point is that American innovation is \\nworking and that's why the carbon footprint of American is 14 \\npercent less today than it was a decade ago.\\n    So, my first question is for Dr. Holtz-Eakin. And I want to \\nsay thank you for your Daily Dish newsletter, which I still \\nread daily and appreciate your thoughts on the economy. You \\nkind of mentioned this in your testimony. As we try to solve \\nthe problem here, which we all believe that the environment is \\na challenge for us right now, do you think that American \\ninnovation will have a bigger impact going forward or do you \\nthink that a federal government heavy hand approach will have \\nbetter results. And my question is, is the cure worse than the \\ndisease that the federal government keeps prescribing all these \\nexpensive propositions, is the cure worse than the disease?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Thank you for the questions and the \\ncompliments. I'm not sure that the latter is deserved, but \\nthank you.\\n    There's a real issue in having the climate strategy and the \\neconomic growth strategy work hand-in-hand. And one of the \\npoints I tried to make in my opening remarks is that at the \\nmoment the federal budget is an enormous headwind to economic \\ngrowth and if we have a climate strategy that exacerbates the \\nbudget problems it is going to make even worse the challenges \\non raising the standard of living for future generations. And \\nso, I worry a lot about that.\\n    I also worry about the fact that we are not guaranteed to \\nget anything out of something like the Inflation Reduction Act \\nbecause it has no sort of global coordination and this is \\nultimately a global problem. And so, when I think about \\nclimate, I come to the conclusion that the global challenge \\nwill not be solved without great U.S. leadership. I simply do \\nnot believe it is possible for the U.S. to be a laggard in this \\nregard and have there be any real progress.\\n    It will not be the case that we can make great progress and \\nthen provide that leadership if we are crippled by the budget \\noutlook that we have. And if we don't undertake a strategy that \\nfeatures innovation--and I have for a long time been an \\nadvocate of using carbon pricing, carbon taxes, in particular. \\nWell-designed carbon taxes are huge incentives for \\nefficiencies, innovation that are completely decentralized.\\n    On the ground people decide how they want to respond to \\nprice incentives. That's what made the U.S. economy the single \\ngreatest economy in the history of the world, using the same \\ntechniques to address this problem would be exactly the right \\nway to go. And so, I think the strategy that the Administration \\nhas adopted is not the best strategy. I think it will yield \\nlittle, quite frankly, in time and benefits.\\n    Senator Marshall. Thank you. My next question is for Dr. \\nCarney. Two questions, Dr. Carney, as you make your assessment \\nof climate, you talk a lot about carbon footprints. How do you \\nassess the cradle to grave impacts of what you're looking at? \\nHow do you calculate the cost of implementing your policies? \\nAnd I'm going to give you a ``for instance.''\\n    So, like Iowa, Kansas, over 50 percent of our electricity \\nis generated from wind. Unfortunately, wind energy is seven \\ntimes more per kilowatt to produce than from natural gas. Solar \\nis probably 70 times per kilowatt more than from natural gas. \\nAnd then when we transport that electricity, transporting \\nelectricity is 10 times more expensive than transporting \\nnatural gas. So, we're exporting a lot of that wind generator \\nelectricity and the cost of generating it and transporting is--\\nyou know, do the math, 70, 100 times more expensive.\\n    So, my question, going back to you, Dr. Carney, is how do \\nyou address the entire cradle to grave impact of your policies, \\nnot just the carbon footprint and how do you calculate the cost \\nof implementing your plans?\\n    Dr. Carney. Thank you. Chair just cut me off when I used up \\ntoo much time. Very quickly, I might refrain cradle to grave, \\nSenator, as well wheeled. So, the all-in cost of delivered \\nenergy. I would point out that the levelized cost of wind and \\nsolar, new wind and solar is now comparable, if not through, in \\nmany jurisdictions. It is less expensive than natural gas is \\nthe first point.\\n    The second point, and of course, subject to fewer price \\nfluctuations in local and world markets. And then a quick \\npoint, if I may, just to pick up on the fiscal point, I'll just \\nread into the record that one of the most effective mechanisms, \\nand the Chair referenced this at the start, is credible climate \\npolicy that would include regulation. And when you combine that \\nwith the financial sector and businesses having the right \\ninformation, you get the investment in technologies that are \\nefficient today, cost effective, and in the types of \\ninnovations that will be necessary tomorrow. And I'll just \\nrefer to a detailed analysis that Secretary Yellen and I did \\nprior to her----\\n    Senator Marshall.

One of the largest investors in energy, so \\nthat's what we based it off.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Van Hollen.\",\n",
       " \"STATEMENT OF SENATOR VAN HOLLEN\\n\\n    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank all of \\nyou for your testimony today.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin, I agree with your comments on carbon \\npricing. Many of us pushed for that for many years with \\nappropriate safeguards like border adjustments to protect U.S. \\ndomestic industry. This is not a puritan statement. It's a \\nstatement of fact. We weren't able to get any support here in \\nCongress from the other side of the aisle on that and that's \\nwhy I strongly support the approach that we took in the \\nInflation Reduction Act because we have to do something and I \\nthink if you look at it we will achieve significant reductions \\nin greenhouse gas emissions, not as much as I would like, and \\nthat brings me to a couple of points.\\n    Number one, first of all, I think there are huge economic \\nopportunities and job opportunities in going forward with the \\nclean energy transition. In my state of Maryland, we have two \\noffshore wind facilities that are being built, 10,000 good \\npaying jobs projected from those two facilities.\\n    We also know that the cost of doing nothing is huge and \\nthat's part of the purpose of this, today's hearing. And those \\ncosts are being borne as we speak in terms of taxpayer dollars \\nfor more climate resilience at the local level, at the state \\nlevel, at the federal level and the cost that insurers or \\nindividual citizens are paying through insurance and through \\nnon-insurance and just the impact on them and their property \\nand their lives.\\n    Mr. Litterman, you testified, and I'm quoting here that \\n``insurance markets are critical to diversify these risks and \\nto create appropriate incentives for individuals, companies, \\nand communities to prepare for extreme weather by building \\nharden infrastructure in buildings.'' You go onto say ``but the \\ninsurance markets are not working properly because historical \\nloss experience is no longer relevant for predicting future \\nlosses.''\\n    I noted that in Florida and Louisiana and California, at \\nleast one of those three states if not all of them you're \\nseeing just last year a number of insurance companies go \\ninsolvent because they just couldn't pay the bill for extreme \\nweather events. Can you expand on the comment you made about us \\nbeing unprepared when it comes to insurance to capture this \\nrisk.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Sure. Insurance companies base their pricing \\non historical experience. That historical experience is no \\nlonger relevant. We are in a new weather environment now and so \\nwe see these tail events happening much more frequently than \\nthey have historically. We have to base insurance on what's \\nactually going to happen or insurance companies are going to \\npull back. Look at California and wildfires. The probability of \\ngetting wildfires is now much higher than it was historically. \\nEveryone knows that, including insurance companies. And so, if \\nyou want to buy insurance, insurance companies they're going to \\nraise the premium, but the insurance regulators won't allow \\nthem to raise the premium because based on what they say. Show \\nme the data. Well, the data is changing every day. These things \\nare becoming more and more likely and so the insurance markets \\nare not working. Reinsurers understand this. They see the risks \\nand they say we won't underwrite these losses because we see \\nthem coming and so these markets are just not working.\\n    And then you get Florida, the federal government says we'll \\nprovide the flood insurance. California says taxpayers will \\nunderwrite the costs of fire insurance. This leads to incorrect \\nincentives. What people should be doing is recognizing that we \\nneed hardened infrastructure. We shouldn't be living in risky \\nplaces and we certainly don't want the federal government to be \\nsubsidizing people to live in areas where it's more expensive. \\nThat's just going to increase the total cost in the long run.\\n    So, we have to face the reality. I love what Professor \\nHoltz-Eakin said. We need to put a price on it. We need to \\ncreate incentives. People respond to incentives. That's all \\nthere is to it. And so, we get the right incentives, we'll get \\nthe right behaviors. If we have the wrong incentives, and the \\ninsurance industry right now we have the wrong incentives, and \\nso we get the wrong behavior.\\n    Senator Van Hollen. Can you speak a little more to the \\nsecondary market of insurers? Because as you said they get it, \\nright? Costs are going up as I look at these facts in Florida \\nafter six insurance companies went insolvent in 2022 alone, you \\nnow see premiums averaging more than $4,200 per year, almost \\nthree times the national average.\\n    So, as you say, at the end of the day, you're going to pick \\nup the tab, right? I mean you're gong to pick up the tab, \\neither the taxpayer or you're going to have to pick up the tab \\nthrough much higher home insurance rates and other insurance \\nrates, which is why obviously the best course of action is to \\ntry to address the issue at its root and reduce the impact to \\nclimate change. But obviously, we're in this already so we have \\nto provide the resilience.\\n    I can tell you in my state of Maryland, just over the last \\nfour years if you look at it, in the last few years we've seen \\na dramatic increase in extreme weather events, costing the \\nState of Maryland billions and billions of dollars. So, we're \\ngoing to pay one way or another if we don't figure out how to \\naddress this. And as I said, there's huge opportunities, \\neconomically and job-wise in addressing them. Thank you, Mr. \\nChairman.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you Senator Van Hollen. Do you \\ncare to respond?\\n    Dr. Litterman. I would just say that we can do better.\\n    There are models that we can run. We can get better \\nestimates of what the risks are, whether it's flooding or heat \\nor smoke and so on, and we should. So, basically what the \\ninsurance market is going to have to do is start relying on \\nclimate models to project into the future what these risks are.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Romney. Thank you for your \\npatience.\\n    Senator Romney. Pardon?\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you for your patience.\",\n",
       " \"STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROMNEY\\n\\n    Senator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no question \\nabout the impact of climate change. It's going to be \\nsignificant, devastating in some areas more than others. The \\nquestion is whether we're doing things that will actually make \\na difference and will lead to a different result.\\n    What I'm concerned about is that most of what we do here in \\nthe United States is--well, I'll call it virtual signaling. \\nThat term has been used recently. But we do a lot of things \\nthat make us feel good about ourselves, but will have almost \\nimpact on global emissions. If we want to do something serious \\nabout global emissions, we need to put a price on carbon.\\n    And our Democrat friends had the chance to do that during \\nreconciliation. They didn't. And so, we can talk about all \\nthese other things we're doing and getting more batteries for \\ncars and so forth, but the reason these things don't make a big \\ndifference is because the U.S. is not the big contributor to \\nemissions in the world. China is and Brazil and India and \\nIndonesia and all of the growth is going to come from them.\\n    China's emissions are greater than the U.S., the EU, and \\nJapan combined. So, when we do things here that are very \\nexpensive and disruptive to our economy, they don't change \\nwhat's happening globally. We have to do things that have \\nglobal impacts. So, research and technology and a price on \\ncarbon are the things that would make a difference.\\n    So, it's frustrating to talk about this as a huge challenge \\nto our budget and to our economy when it's out of control, \\nunless we deal with them the way I've just described. And yet, \\nthere is something that is in our control that both parties are \\nsaying we won't touch that. And what is in our control is the \\nlevel of debt we have. I just heard Professor Holtz-Eakin just \\nindicate that the impact on the economy of the amount of debt \\nwe're adding up is 10 times the impact of climate change, 10 \\ntimes. And yet, we're not willing to look at our entitlement \\nprograms to see if we can balance them somehow.\\n    I'm not talking about cutting them or taxing them. I just \\nsaying let's at least come together and work on it. But the \\nparties are afraid to even come together and have a discussion \\nabout how could we balance these things. It strikes me as one \\nof the most outrageous things my generation has done to the \\ncoming generations is to say we're going to spend on this money \\non ourselves. We're not going to tax ourselves to compensate \\nfor all that we're giving to ourselves. We're going to take all \\nthis money and then we're going to pass onto you for all of \\nyour lives slower growth so a more challenged economy and \\nhigher interest payments. It's unbelievable. It's almost \\nimmoral.\\n    So, I look at this challenge, Professor Holtz-Eakin, am I \\nreading this right that the challenge of the debt and our \\nunwillingness to balance what we spend with what we tax that \\nthat unwillingness is having a huge impact on economic growth \\nover the future and on the lives of our grandchildren and \\ntheirs?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I think it's well said. I'd just amended \\nit in two ways. I would take out almost in front of immoral and \\nI would say that it's a disservice to the beneficiaries in \\nSocial Security and Medicare to pretend that somehow they can \\nsurvive in their current form. They cannot. Trust funds will \\nexhaust in under a decade, Social Security trust fund in a \\ndecade.\\n    It is an enormous irony that something like the Social \\nSecurity program, which was meant to eliminate income \\nuncertainty in retirement and in old age is now the greatest \\nsource of income uncertainty in retirement and old age because \\nwe have no idea what that program will look like as the years \\nroll forward.\\n    So, I personally I'm enormously disappointed at a public \\ndebate that suggest we can't touch Social Security and \\nMedicaid. They are the only things we should touch. They are \\nthe most important things to touch and I would encourage this \\nCommittee to put that on their list.\\n    Senator Romney. Thank you. Dr. Litterman, I described what \\nI thought were the major levers that would have an impact on \\nemissions and climate and that came from a model that was \\npresented by a professor at MIT. They built this huge model \\nthere that shows all the things you could do and the impact \\nthey have. What was shocking was almost everything we talk \\nabout or we are excited about has no real impact globally, \\nexcept a price on carbon and of course investments in new \\ntechnology and innovation.\\n    Some of that is on the table, but the price on carbon never \\nhave; am I wrong on that or is that a fair assessment?\\n    Dr. Litterman. No, you're absolutely right. In fact, I \\nwould go further because when we talk about the budget deficit, \\nas Professor Holtz-Eakin knows, a carbon tax is a great way to \\nraise revenues. Polluters pay and that reduces the deficit, so \\nof course that's the right way to do it.\\n    And another thing I would say is that you're absolutely \\nright about the global perspective. This is not a U.S. problem. \\nThis is a global problem and the U.S. has to join the global \\ncommunity in creating harmonized incentives to reduce emissions \\nglobally. And right now those incentives vary across the board. \\nThe U.S. is kind of in the middle with very little incentives, \\nbut you know what our strongest incentive to reduce emissions \\ncomes from a gasoline tax. If I drive an electric vehicle, I \\ndon't pay it, but that's not a strong incentive, okay?\\n    In Europe, the incentives to reduce emissions are over a \\nhundred dollars a ton. In many Middle East countries, Russia, \\nVenezuela, there are strong subsidies to increase pollution \\nbecause they have fixed prices on fossil fuels, which are below \\nthe market. So, we've got to move diplomatically, and I would \\nsay what we have to do in the U.S. is provide our State \\nDepartment with the tools that they can go and negotiate \\nglobally to get these harmonized incentives to reduce \\nemissions.\\n    Senator Romney. Thank you. Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks Senator Romney. Senator Kaine.\",\n",
       " \"STATEMENT OF SENATOR KAINE\\n\\n    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thanks for \\nkicking off our 118th Congress meetings of the Budget Committee \\nwith this important topic and thank you to the witnesses.\\n    So, I represent Virginia and it's a coastal state. Our \\nshoreline stretches more than 5,000 miles if you include all \\nthe snaking waterways around the Chesapeake Bay and the \\nAtlantic. And it's home to assets like the world's largest Navy \\nbase, one of the largest cargo ports in the United States, \\ntourism destinations like Virginia Beach and historic \\nJamestown, as well as commercial and residential districts, the \\nsecond largest metropolitan area in Virginia is the Hampton \\nRoad area. It's about 1.7 million people.\\n    Hampton Roads is listed behind New Orleans as the most \\nvulnerable community in the country to sea level rise and this \\nis not the only part of Virginia that's affected by climate \\nchange. We see intense rainstorms and flooding in the \\nAppalachian region of Virginia that cause much more severe \\ndamage than they have in the past. Even though the annual \\nrainfall hasn't changed much, it tends to come in much more \\nviolent episodes than it has in the past because of climate \\nchange, so obviously very interested in this topic.\\n    One of the things that I've been troubled by, and I want to \\npick up a little bit, Senator Romney was talking about debt and \\nspending and wanting to spend the right way, not the wrong way. \\nOne of the things I've been troubled by 10 years here in the \\nSenate is it seems like we are willing to spend a lot of money \\non climate change, but only in this sense, we spend in response \\nto emergencies.\\n    So, we'll do a superstorm Sandy emergency relief package in \\nthe aftermath of some significant climate event and you can \\npretty much count on bipartisanship. We'll try to find ways to \\nhelp our communities out when they've been hurt or we'll \\nrewrite the Federal Flood Insurance Program to provide more and \\nmore financial support for those whose residences and \\nbusinesses are getting more severe flood damage than they have \\nin the past.\\n    So, we'll come to respond on the backend, but what has been \\nharder to do is find smart resilience funding or even, more \\nimportantly, smart prevention funding. I do think, as Senator \\nRomney said, we are on the prevention side, some of the \\nresearch investments either in the Chips and Research bill and \\nin the Infrastructure bill or maybe frontloading some of these \\nexpenses in the prevention side.\\n    But if either of you would just have thoughts about in \\nspending and investing how should we be balancing between \\nprevention, resilience, and response and is there a way we \\nshould adjust that dial to make it more likely effective?\\n    Dr. Litterman. Well, I think the most important thing we \\ncan do is create the incentive now to prevent this problem from \\ngetting bigger and bigger into the future, so that's what we \\nhave to do immediately. The costs themselves are primarily in \\nthe future and so, among other things, we have to be prepared.\\n    I think in terms of what we really need to do to address \\nthis problem, as one of the senators mentioned, we have to \\ncreate the innovation to create the new types of energy--the \\nenergy, the infrastructure, the housing, and so on that will be \\nresilient to the future that's coming. And in order to do that, \\nin order to generate the innovation and the capital and so on, \\nwhat we need is to create the expectation among investors that \\nthere will be incentives that will pay--you know, if you have a \\nlow carbon approach that it'll be more profitable.\\n    Senator Kaine. Can I just say what about innovation and \\nthen I did want to have the Professor respond as well. One the \\nthings I like as sort of a little virtuous competition in the \\ninnovation space. I know some of what we did in the IRA has \\nmade European nations kind of mad, like what you're trying to \\ndo things that will make it harder for industries. But then \\nthey've decided, well, maybe we'd better up or investments as \\nwell and that kind of virtuous competition it can lead to some \\ntough words between otherwise allied nations, but it may not be \\nbad in terms of the overall goal. Dr. Holtz-Eakin, I know you \\nwanted to say something.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Just briefly, I mean if you take the flood \\ninsurance program as an example, for long periods we didn't \\nupdate the web maps and delivery didn't update the flood maps, \\nso that's a terrible idea. You have to know the risks you face \\nand then once you have those risks they have to be priced \\neffectively. And that means in some cases premiums that are \\nmuch higher than have been historically. That becomes \\nuncomfortable. Let's be honest about that. But it provides \\nexactly the right innovation and other incentives.\\n    Don't build a house where it doesn't belong, right, then, \\nyou will not have to pay out of the flood program when it gets \\nhit. New businesses to places are more secure for the future. \\nAll of that is the best kind of signal to send and it comes \\nfrom really doing mundane structural things in a lot of federal \\nprograms, but we're not doing that.\\n    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you very much, Senator Kaine. \\nSenator Graham, followed by Senator Kennedy and then Senator \\nBraun, unless we have Democrats that are mediating. Go ahead, \\nSenator Graham.\",\n",
       " \"STATEMENT OF SENATOR GRAHAM\\n\\n    Senator Graham. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. This is a hearing \\nworth having, for sure. So, we all sort of agree on the \\nproblem. Climate change is real. It's affecting quality life on \\nthe planet over time. We all agree with that. What to do about \\nit is problematic, but let's talk about pricing carbon. Your \\nprice on carbon what would that translate to, Doug, in terms of \\nincreasing gas prices?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I don't have a specific price for carbon \\nthat I would translate into gas prices, but the literature says \\nvery clearly that the right way to do this is to have----\\n    Senator Graham. No, I got it. I got it.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Let me finish. Let me finish. It's a \\nrevenue neutral carbon tax so that you use the revenues to get \\nrid of other taxes that people who make gasoline will have to \\npay. So, the net impact on the pump prices is not always from \\nthat. Again, something is going down, not just up.\\n    Senator Graham. So, revenue neutral gas tax. You take the \\nmoney you collect from gas taxes and you offset obligations in \\nother areas, right?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Revenue neutral carbon tax economy-wide so \\nthat you can use the revenues to diminish taxes on capital and \\nlabor. Those are corporate income taxes, income taxes, payroll \\ntaxes.\\n    Senator Graham. Now, I'm making $20 an hour in South \\nCarolina. How do I get my money back for an increase gas tax?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Payroll tax reduction.\\n    Senator Graham. Okay. And how does that affect Social \\nSecurity?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Sadly, in reality, it doesn't affect \\nSocial Security very much because it's already not going to \\nhave enough money, so you better figure that out.\\n    Senator Graham. Okay. What would you do?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, Senator, I really like Senator \\nWyden's plan that didn't get into the Build Back Better, but he \\nsuggested that we have a low carbon tax to begin with, exclude \\ngasoline, and then allow the incentive to rise quickly and so, \\nthere are various ways to address this. I would say that the \\ngasoline is very inelastic and so you really don't impact very \\nmuch the amount of pollution by putting on a gasoline tax. I \\nthink there's much better ways to address it.\\n    Senator Graham. How would it affect utility bills, this \\napproach?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. How would----\\n    Senator Graham. Yes. I mean somebody's got to pay. Carbon's \\ngenerated through transportation and production of energy \\nitself.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, Senator, I'm not an expert on \\nutility, but I believe that utilities around the country have \\nvery different carbon footprints. So, in an area where you have \\nclean electricity it wouldn't be much of an impact.\\n    Senator Graham. I'm generally supportive, but the problem \\nwith this is we talk in circles. I'm asking you if we go down \\nthis road how much will your utility bill go up, how much gas \\nprices will go up, we need to actually talk more honestly about \\nthat. How about something maybe we can agree on, that if we \\ndon't get China and India and other big emitters to do better \\nit doesn't really matter a whole lot what we do here; do you \\nagree with that, Doug?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I do agree with that.\\n    Senator Graham. Does everybody on the panel agree with \\nthat? Is one way to do that a border adjusted carbon fee?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Certainly, if we had a global regime with \\npeople already doing something, right, then we should have a \\nborder adjustment.\\n    Senator Graham. Mr. Litterman.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Absolutely. Absolutely. I think it's a great \\nway to go and I think it's something that both parties can \\nagree on, so let's move forward.\\n    Senator Graham. So, if you're looking to make big polluters \\nlike China and India to change their behavior, we do all the \\nthings here at home may drive up prices. When they send \\nproducts into the country, they're going to pay a pollution \\nfee, for lack of a better term. You agree with that?\\n    Dr. Litterman. Oh, yeah, absolutely. We need to measure the \\nincentives globally to reduce the emissions, we need to \\nharmonize them, and we need to get them to the appropriate \\nlevel, so let's work together to do that.\\n    Senator Graham. If we do electrification of the vehicle \\nfleet along the lines that car companies are talking about by \\n2035, 2040, how much demand in power production will that \\ncreate in America?\\n    Dr. Litterman. I don't know, Senator.\\n    Senator Graham. Do you know, Doug?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I don't know the number off the top of my \\nhead. I'd be happy to get it to you. But in my written \\ntestimony----\\n    Senator Graham. Like a lot.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. But in my written testimony.\\n    Senator Graham. It's like a lot.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. It's like a lot.\\n    Senator Graham. It's like a lot. Where does that ``a lot'' \\ncome from? Can you do it without natural gas?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I don't think so.\\n    Senator Graham. Can you do it without natural gas, Mr. \\nLitterman?\\n    Dr. Litterman. Oh, yeah, absolutely.\\n    Senator Graham. Okay.\\n    Dr. Litterman. What you need to do is you need to create \\nthe right incentives and let the market work.\\n    Senator Graham. Time out. How much increase in demand for \\npower or power will come from electrifying the vehicle fleet? \\nHow much, 100 percent, 50 percent, 10 percent, 200 percent? Do \\nyou have a clue?\\n    Dr. Litterman. How much of the electricity demand will be \\nincreased by electrifying----\\n    Senator Graham. To cars or plugging into something.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Yes, I don't know.\\n    Senator Graham. How can you say if you don't know there's \\nno need for gas? This is the problem. Thanks.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Who said there was no need for gas, Senator?\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Kennedy is up next, followed \\nby Senator Braun.

Yes, I \\ndo, and it will be in the best interest of China to work with \\nthe United States to address this problem.\\n    Senator Kennedy. So, you think the answer is yes?\\n    Dr. Litterman.

I've been four \\nyears on the Budget Committee each year and the last two years \\nprior to this we did 16 hearings and we didn't do one hearing \\non the mechanics of actually doing a budget. This is the Budget \\nCommittee and we haven't put one together fully budgeted and \\nappropriate on time in 25 years.\\n    I've got four kids that now run my business, three of my \\nfour kids, and I was on a school board 10 years, state \\nlegislator for three years. No other place works like that and \\nhas a business plan that works into the future. I also come to \\nthe Senate and believe, as Republicans and conservatives, that \\nif we don't weigh in on big issues of the day shame on us. Then \\nwe're going to be at the expense of whatever the other idea is.\\n    Started the Climate Caucus back six months after I got \\nhere. Got six other Republicans to join and we've been an \\nengaging caucus, a real caucus that's met over time. So, the \\nissues are there, but I think until we--unless we want to \\nchange the name of this Committee to the General Issues of \\nConcern Committee, we owe it to the American public that we're \\nnot going to base it upon doing no budgeting, no appropriating, \\ndoing it behind closed doors, and dropping 4100 page bills in \\nour lap that none of us can read through and then having the \\ngall to borrow the money from our kids and our grandkids. That \\nis shameful.\\n    We should be fleshing out the climate issues probably in \\nEPW. I've been the loudest senator on the Republic side that \\nsays we have a broken healthcare system. Fixed it in my own \\nbusiness 15 years ago, made it consumer driven, but skin in the \\ngame from my own employees to be real healthcare consumers, cut \\ncosts by 50 percent, have not had premium increases in 15 \\nyears. That sounds like it'd be unbelievable, but it's true. \\nWhen you do things that make sense and that are sustainable. \\nYou know I've got healthier employees for that now.\\n    So, healthcare, it's breaking the bank in terms of \\nmentioned earlier Medicare until you reform the healthcare \\nindustry and embrace competition, transparency, don't get \\nhospitals all the rules and regs they need to become an \\nunregulated utility like a monopoly in the sense of how they \\nwork, probably going to see costs going up.\\n    So, I'm not going to weigh in on the climate issue, other \\nthan we've doing it. The experts there, the leaders and \\ncaptains of industry I think are accepting it as an issue. It's \\ngoing to be solved in that area through technology, not here. \\nAnd it does beg the question when China's building a coal-fired \\nplant weekly how does that hold thing fit into the equation?\\n    So, I want to cite a few more statistics and then I'm going \\nto ask Mr. Carney, who is out there in the cyber world and Dr. \\nHoltz-Eakin, what you think about the trajectory we're on. The \\nonly budget out there that anybody's had the nerve to be I did \\nit last year, privilege motion. We should discharge a budget \\nresolution by April 1st. There'll be some of us that do that \\nagain, but just cutting to what we do do, which is no \\nbudgeting, no appropriating, and then whether you believe in \\nreforming things on a climate basis and healthcare. What about \\nthe idea that we're adding trillions to our national debt, 18 \\ntrillion when I got here, now 31 trillion. Start back in 2000 \\nwhen we put a couple wars on the credit card. That took us from \\n5 trillion in debt to 10 trillion.\\n    Next Administration said, well, we're not going to be \\noutdone, added another 6 trillion. I get here it's 18 trillion. \\nIt's been off the rails ever since. Let's start with Mr. \\nCarney. You come from the banking industry. I debated Bernie \\nSanders for 25 minutes on the Senate floor about the modern \\nmonetary theory. Can we keep borrowing and borrowing without \\nhaving the consequences of crowding out all the issues that are \\ngoing to come into play, is that a viable long-term business \\nplan? And I'd like Dr. Holtz-Eakin to weigh in as well.\\n    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Senator. I'll make a couple quick \\ncomments. The first is that crowding out is an issue. I think \\nProfessor Holtz-Eakin has made this point in this forum and \\nother fora. And secondly, it is a relevant issue for climate \\nchange because of the cost of adaptation, resilience, and \\ndelayed action is going to lead to much greater crowding out \\nand bigger economic impacts as well. So, the fiscal situation \\nyou described, and I won't' comment on obviously on U.S. \\nsituation, but this underscores the importance of revenue \\nneutral use of regulation and effective policies that other \\nsenators have been referencing.\\n    Last point I'll make before handing it over to the other \\nwitness is I would just refer, given the earlier discussion, to \\nthe carbon tax in Canada, which is revenue neutral, is returned \\nto Canadians and insures about 70 percent of Canadian \\nhouseholds. I'm going to net ahead.\\n    Senator Braun. What about the modern monetary theory, \\nclimate aside?\\n    Dr. Litterman. I don't want to----\\n    Senator Braun. I figured you may not weigh in on that. Go \\nahead.\\n    Dr. Litterman. No, that's a theory to which I do not \\nsubscribe.\\n    Senator Braun. Well, I can tell you it's a bad theory. \\nAnywhere else you borrow from future generations it does not \\nwork out. Dr. Holtz-Eakin.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, one, the federal budget is on an \\nunsustainable structure and its getting worse. Two, it is \\nimposing costs on the economy today and will increasingly \\nimpose those costs. The carving out is real. And three, there \\nis nothing about modern monetary theory that coincides with the \\nreal-world experience. It's just incorrect.\\n    Senator Braun. Yes. And thank you for that. And I think we \\nshould try to discharge a budget resolution by April 15th, if \\nnot, I will take one to the floor again because it's our \\nresponsibility to our kids and grandkids not to run this place \\nlike we currently run it.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Lee.\",\n",
       " \"STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEE\\n\\n    Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to take a \\nbrief moment to say that I appreciate the opportunity to serve \\non the Budget Committee as a new member and especially to do so \\nat a time when the state of our federal budget is in such \\nprofound disrepair, perhaps more so than at any other time in \\nour nation's history.\\n    Fifteen years ago, our public debt measured as a percentage \\nof the American economy, was at just 35 percent. Today it \\nstands at 100 percent and according to fairly rosy projections \\nwithin the next few decades it'll get up to 200 percent. And \\nwhether it's decades or just a few years away, we will reach a \\npoint where our interest on the national debt becomes the \\nlargest line item we have, bigger than Social Security or \\nMedicare or Defense.\\n    This fiscally irresponsible path that our federal budget is \\non is something that increases significantly the odds of a debt \\ncrisis and the associated economic pain that will inevitably be \\nborne by the American public, if and when that crisis arrives \\nin its full force.\\n    Just last year the Congressional Budget Office noted that \\nthe very tangible consequences of our federal debt needed to be \\nkept in mind or the high and rising federal debt that CBO \\nprojects over the next three decades would have serious \\nconsequences for the economy and federal budgeting, including \\nthe crowding out of private investment, higher interest costs, \\nand increased risk of a fiscal crisis.\\n    So, let's not fool ourselves. And most importantly, let's \\nnot fool those we represent, the American people. Blooming \\ndeficits and surging debt have been driven by and will continue \\nto be driven by runaway profligate spending by the federal \\ngovernment, not because of any effects of climate change. That \\nis a different thing. That's not what has caused our ballooning \\ndebt and deficit.\\n    There has become an all to prevalent quality in American \\npolitical discourse and specifically among many in the United \\nStates Senate and on the left who seek to climate alarmism to \\njustify a widespread federal government takeover of our economy \\nand a radical, unrealistic and damaging transition of our \\nenergy sector with all of its abruptness and all of its \\ndisregarding of things that have worked and helped elevate \\npeople out of poverty. And yes, even helped, in many instances, \\nclean up the environment.\\n    Dating back to at least the 1970s, a group of left-wing \\nacademics and media allies began making apocalyptic claims \\nabout climate change, stipulating that climate-related \\napocalyptic events would wipe out hundreds of millions if not \\nbillions of the Earth's human inhabitants over the next few \\ndecades. What's more concerning than the kooky theories of Paul \\nEhrlich or Thomas Malthus that a growing number of Democratic \\nmembers of Congress, bureaucrats, and private sector business \\npeople are now making similarly outlandish and inflammatory \\nalarmist claims about a looming climate apocalypse or at least \\nthrow support behind green new deal style legislative proposals \\nand regulatory mandates.\\n    Not only is this supremely misguided and shortsighted, but \\nit's not remotely necessary. It certainly isn't desirable. The \\nreality is that U.S. energy-related carbon emissions have been \\nsteadily declining over the last 15 years without any green new \\ndeal styled takeover of the federal budget and the American \\neconomy. And the same time China's carbon emissions have nearly \\ndoubled over that same time period.\\n    Democrats in Congress and in the Biden Administration need \\nto work with Republicans to promote American energy \\nindependence rather than promoting less efficient forms of \\nenergy, especially at a time of significant energy inflation. \\nAnd it's been financially debilitating to low- and middle-\\nincome American households. And those energy costs translate \\nalso to higher food costs and higher costs for everything we \\nbuy and everything we do.\\n    These costs don't fall on the wealthy like they fall on the \\npoor and middle class. But brazen regulatory overreach \\ncurrently being carried out by unelected and unaccountable \\nbureaucrats must come to an end as those decisions of making \\nlaw are expressly reserved for Congress under Article I, \\nSections 1 and 7 of the U.S. Constitution.\\n    Lastly, it's my hope that this Committee will spend more of \\nits time and effort this Congress deliberating ways to reduce \\nour budget deficits so that we can stabilize our debt while \\nputting our budget on a pathway to balance. Thank you, Mr. \\nChairman.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Lee. To be clear, \\nthe reason we're having this hearing and the reason that we're \\ngoing to continue to have hearings on this subject is that $10 \\ntrillion of our federal debt can be ascribed to exogenous \\nshocks to our economy with which we had to cope. It wasn't \\ncheap, but we had to do it.\\n    The biggest exogenous shock on the horizon out there is \\nclimate upheaval. That's not just me. That's bankers, corporate \\nCEOs, scientists, economists, people who will look at this \\nproblem all around the world. And it matters because we have \\nthe chance to head it off now if we take appropriate steps, \\nmany of which, as we've heard in this hearing, have support on \\nboth sides of the aisle.\\n    I'll also add that I mentioned at the beginning of the \\nhearing the prospect of healthcare reforms that can lower \\ncosts. Accountable care organizations were a perfect example of \\nthat and I look forward to working with members on both sides \\nof the aisle and with CBO to drill into the cost bases for that \\nand try to figure out we can do to do more of what looks like \\nalready trillions of dollars in healthcare savings that are \\nprojected from these changes.\\n    But I'll close with a round of questioning. I didn't have \\nthe chance to ask Dr. Holtz-Eakin questions, so I'm going to \\nyield myself a second round. And let me ask you, Dr. Holtz-\\nEakin, in preparing your testimony today did you familiarize \\nyourself with the Bank of International Settlements so-called \\nGreen Swan Report, which warns of, and I quote, ``catastrophic \\nand irreversible impacts from climate so large that''--and \\nquoted them again--``it would make quantifying financial \\ndamages impossible?''\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. No, I did not read that report.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \\nreport put out in April of 2019 by dozens of central banks that \\nsays, ``Estimates of losses are large and range up to $20 \\ntrillion when looking at the economy more broadly.''\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I don't know that report.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \\nDeloitte Global Turning Point Report, which concluded that in \\n2070 alone global GDP could be 7.6 percent lower compared to a \\nbaseline that does not account for climate change.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I read that report--scanned that report \\nwhen it first came out.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \\nreport from economists largely centralized in Cambridge, but \\nfrom around the world that said that the effect on the U.S. \\neconomy would be more than $3 trillion in losses and GDP could \\nshrink by more than 5 percent due to the collapse of stranded \\nassets?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I scanned that one as well when it came \\nout.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \\nreport from Freddie Mac, the American mortgage giant that said, \\nand I'm quoting here, that the economic losses and social \\ndisruption related to coastal property losses ``are likely to \\nbe greater in total than those experienced in the housing \\ncrisis and the Great Recession.''\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. No.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. I gather you did familiarize yourself \\nwith the CSTC Report that Litterman wrote. Correct?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. When it was released. Yes.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. And when it was released, its opening \\nsentence was ``Climate change poses a major risk to the \\nstability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to \\nsustain the American economy,'' is that correct?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Yes.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. And the second paragraph after its \\nheader says, ``Risks include disorderly price adjustments in \\nvarious assets classes with possible spillovers into different \\nparts of the financial system as well as potential disruption \\nof the proper functioning of financial markets.'' Not a good \\noutcome, right?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Not desirable.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Not desirable indeed. And then it also \\nsaid, ``A central finding of this report is that climate change \\ncould pose systemic risks to the U.S. financial system across \\nmultiple sectors, geographies, and assets in the United States, \\nsometimes simultaneously, and within a relatively short \\ntimeframe.'' Do you recall it saying that?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Not specifically, but I believe that.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. And you wrote a little report on it in \\nSeptember of 2020 which noted that climate induced risks will \\ncause dramatic financial fluctuations and the stability of the \\nsystem will be at risk. And then on the backside of your one-\\npager, you said that the potential risks to financial markets \\nposed by climate change represent a pervasive policy challenge. \\nHave I quoted you correctly?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Yes.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you. Closing words to Dr. \\nLitterman.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Yes. I would just say I am surprised, \\npleasantly surprised by the amount of agreement by certainly \\nthe witnesses here and the senators as well, and so I hope we \\ncan move forward. That's all.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Yes. I hope so too when I think that \\nthere are things that we can do. I think the key points coming \\nout of this are that we've got to move forward globally. We \\ncan't pretend that we can build a fence around the United \\nStates, soft climate here and not be affected by what's going \\non in China and India and other places, Russia.\\n    That we do have the tools to effect the behavior of China \\nand India and other countries through carbon border tariffs, \\nthat they're already underway in the European Union. And that \\nif we can pull together and be sensible about this we can take \\nadvantage of--I forget whether it was you, Dr. Litterman or Dr. \\nCarney, who said negative risks, opportunities. That there is a \\nhuge upside to getting this right.\\n    I'll close with the Deloitte number, which was that if we \\ndon't get this right it's $180 trillion in costs to the global \\neconomy. If we do get it right, it's $40 trillion in added \\nvalue. The upside, the negative risks, the opportunities. Let's \\ngo for that.\\n    I want to thank the witnesses for appearing in the \\nCommittee today. Their full statements will be included in the \\nrecord of our proceedings. As information for all senators, \\nquestions for the record, are due by noon tomorrow with signed \\nhard copies delivered to the Committee Clerk in Dirksen 624. \\nEmailed copies are also fine. We will ask the witnesses to \\nrespond to those questions within seven days of receipt of \\nthem.\\n    And with no further business before the Committee, the \\nhearing is adjourned.\\n    [Whereupon, at 11:43 a.m., Wednesday, February 15, 2023, \\nthe hearing was adjourned.]\\n[\",\n",

      "propose responses to climate risks, including the Climate \n",
      "Leadership Council and the Niskanen Center. No doubt, the \n",
      "reason I am here today is because in 2020 I chaired the CFTC \n",
      "Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee, which published a \n",
      "unanimous and widely cited report, Managing Climate Risk in the \n",
      "U.S. Financial System. We had environmental organizations, such \n",

      "but also Agri business companies like Cargill and Bunge. Oil \n",
      "and gas companies like Conoco Phillips and BP, and banks like \n",
      "Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Citi.\n",
      "    There was no collection of wide-eyed environmental \n",
      "activists nor were politics involved. This was a rigorous \n",
      "report with dozens of recommendations from hard-headed experts \n",
      "and we came to the unanimous conclusion that climate change \n",
      "poses significant risks to the American economy that must be \n",
      "addressed urgently.\n",
      "    In the Agricultural sector, for example, we found that \n",

      "decrease labor productivity, degrade soil and water quality, \n",
      "increase the range and virulence of pests and disrupt supply \n",
      "chains. Climate change will also impose large costs on \n",
      "companies and governments.\n",
      "    One example, the CFTC Report, highlighted with the case of \n",
      "Pacific Gas and Electric in California which entered bankruptcy \n",
      "because of $30 billion in liabilities associated with its \n",
      "infrastructure, sparking record wildfires. Extreme weather \n",
      "impacts are already here and are growing rapidly, including \n",
      "heatwaves, floods, hurricanes, drought, and wildfires.\n",
      "    Meanwhile, the effects of climate change loom every larger \n",
      "in the future. Losses from billion-dollar extreme weather \n",
      "events totaled $165 billion last year. And while it varies from \n",
      "year to year, the costs from climate change are clearly growing \n",
      "rapidly. Extreme weather events are becoming more common as the \n",
      "atmosphere warms. Terms such as the 100-Year Flood are used to \n",
      "describe the magnitude of an event that has happened \n",
      "historically on average once every hundred years. That happens \n",
      "to be an important frequency.\n",
      "    We build infrastructure to withstand events that happen on \n",
      "a regular basis and so the damage created by weather that \n",
      "happens regularly is small. But when a 100-year event occurs, \n",
      "the magnitude is so large that we're not prepared and it \n",
      "typically leads to complete destruction of property. The \n",
      "problem is that while such a term continues to describe the \n",
      "magnitude of extreme weather events the frequency of occurrence \n",
      "today tends to be much higher.\n",
      "    Declining real estate values driven by climate-related \n",

      "human health and its impacts will fall hardest on those with \n",
      "fewer resources, increasing inequity.\n",
      "    There are also a number of risks related to crossing a \n",

      "response of a system and there are a number of warning \n",
      "potential tipping points in the climatic system. More worrying \n",
      "still, recent scientific research suggests that we may cross \n",

      "    While the subject of this hearing is the economic risks and \n",
      "costs associated with climate change, I would be remiss if I \n",

      "Grassley, and members of the Committee, thank you for the \n",
      "privilege of being here today. Let me make three points quickly \n",
      "and then I look forward to the chance to answer your questions.\n",
      "    The first point is that climate change will have real \n",
      "impacts on the U.S. economy and these will worsen the federal \n",
      "budget outlook. Unquestionably, there will be additional \n",
      "outlays from the national flood insurance programs and other \n",
      "disaster crop risks kinds of programs and mandatory outlays. \n",
      "The Congress will probably chose to make some discretionary \n",
      "outlays in the future in response to the needs for mitigation \n",
      "and/or adaptation and these will worsen the budget picture, but \n",
      "the biggest impact is going to be lower revenue from an economy \n",
      "that grows more slowly over the long term and that the loss of \n",
      "some capital assets, diminished labor productivity, diminished \n",
      "productivity in agricultural lands will cumulatively reduce \n",
      "inflows to the federal budget.\n",
      "    The Congressional Budget Office recently took a look at \n",
      "this issue and concluded that the center point of set of \n",
      "estimates for the impact would be about a percentage point \n",
      "lower in GDP by 2051. And I would just point out that while \n",
      "that's a significant impact it's tantamount to under a tenth of \n",
      "a percentage point slower growth each and every year.\n",
      "    In contrast, and this point number two, the federal budget \n",
      "presents an immediate and much larger economic threat. We \n",
      "already have debt to GEP in the range of 100 percent and \n",
      "there's a large literature that stems from the work of Ken \n",
      "Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart indicates that countries in that \n",
      "range experience slower growth on the order of a percentage \n",
      "point per year because of their debt burdens. And the U.S. not \n",
      "only has entered that range it has a budget outlook which is \n",
      "unsustainable.\n",
      "    The CBO will put out a revised Economic and Budget Outlook \n",
      "this afternoon at 2 o'clock. It will doubtlessly look like the \n",
      "one they put out last year that shows spending expending \n",
      "revenues as far as the eye can see, driven by very rapid growth \n",
      "in the outlays in Medicare at 7 percent a year, Social Security \n",
      "at 6 percent a year, faster than any revenue source could \n",
      "possibly grow and as a result it will show debt relative to GDP \n",
      "rising as far as the eye can see. The interest costs of \n",
      "carrying that debt rising as far as can see and that is a \n",
      "mechanism which is a guarantee for slower growth in the future.\n",
      "    The point of the borrowing is not just the debt. The point \n",
      "is that that brings resources from the private sector into the \n",
      "government sector. And for every dollar you take from private \n",
      "investment and put into the best of federal infrastructure \n",
      "investments, you lose about 50 percent of the rate of return, \n",
      "so you're losing on every one of those borrowing activities, \n",
      "diminishing the productivity in the economy, lowering the \n",
      "standard of living for future workers in the next generations.\n",
      "    We really don't spend a lot of money on investments in this \n",
      "program and more than likely we're going to take that money \n",
      "from a private investment and put it into a consumption \n",
      "expenditure. That's the point of Social Security and Medicare \n",
      "is to raise the standard of living in retirement for seniors. \n",
      "There's no rate of return to consumption investment, so the \n",
      "federal budget is the biggest headwind to economic growth \n",
      "because it is stacked against investing in the future and needs \n",
      "to be brought into some sort sustainable alignment in order to \n",
      "stop these headwinds to growth.\n",
      "    The other point that's going on in the federal budget is \n",
      "that the mandatory expenditures are crowding out discretionary \n",
      "spending. Discretionary spending is where we do national \n",
      "security, basic research, infrastructure, education, all the \n",
      "places where you can invest in the future of the country and \n",
      "those opportunities are getting squeezed out by the growth of \n",
      "these mandatory programs.\n",
      "    So, point number three, not only would getting the budget \n",
      "on a sustainable trajectory improve the economic outlook, it \n",
      "would free up the budget resources through investments, \n",
      "especially investments in the climate mitigation and adaptation \n",
      "that are so important to this Committee and to this hearing.\n",
      "    And so, I can't think of a single bigger accomplishment \n",

      "    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Chair. It goes back, in part, to \n",
      "your opening comments, some of the points you made in your \n",
      "opening comments, which is that under-investing in resilience \n",
      "upfront leads to much greater costs down the road. And it was \n",
      "particular when I became Governor at the Bank of England and \n",
      "it's not commonly known, but one of the responsibilities of the \n",
      "Bank of England is to oversee the insurance industry and it's \n",
      "the fourth largest insurance industry in the world. It includes \n",
      "one of the largest, if not the largest, re-insurance market, \n",
      "the famous Lords of London, and so therefore that's a property \n",

      "future. I'll refer to Dr. Litterman's comments about one in a \n",

      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Carney, you were in charge of the \n",
      "Bank of Canada after the 2008 financial crisis. Can you compare \n",
      "what you foresee with respect to climate with what you \n",
      "experienced in the 2008 mortgage crisis?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Well, there's two things that I would say. The \n",
      "first is that one of the experiences of that crisis, and many \n",
      "of the members, of course, lived through it and helped managed \n",
      "through it, is what's called a Minsky moment, a realization \n",
      "that basic assumptions were no longer true. For example, that \n",
      "health prices would never fall in the United States, that \n",
      "capital was money good, that assets off balance sheets would \n",
      "stay off balance sheets, all of those proved false and lead to \n",
      "the collapse or virtual collapse of the core, much of the core \n",
      "of the financial system with huge economic costs that \n",
      "ultimately have added to the debt burden of the United States, \n",
      "amongst other countries.\n",
      "    Now, in Canada, we were more fortunate for a variety of \n",
      "reasons, but one of the reasons was we had put more resilience \n",
      "into our financial institutions upfront.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. I'm not getting into Canada \n",
      "specifically. I'm looking between what you project potentially \n",
      "happening with the climate crisis. What's the scale comparison, \n",
      "in your mind, between what we experienced with the 2008 \n",
      "financial crisis and what climate portends for our systems?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Okay, so I'll just lead from that point. The \n",
      "first point is what we want to avoid is a rapid and sudden \n",
      "adjustment to the climate crisis, both adaptation, the impact \n",
      "of fiscal damage or belated investments to address the issue. \n",
      "The orders of magnitude are potentially similar in those cases \n",
      "if we delay adjustment.\n",
      "    If we adjust upfront, actually, I'm of the view that we can \n",
      "actually grow economies through the investments which would \n",
      "improve competitiveness. But if we delay it until it's evident, \n",
      "and this is the tragedy of the horizon supremely evident to \n",
      "everybody, then the orders of magnitude approaches the \n",
      "financial crisis.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. And just to be clear, your testimony \n",
      "is that climate change could reduce the level of global GDP per \n",
      "capita by 10 to 20 percent and in that calculation you leave \n",
      "out critical economic channels that have not been modeled, \n",
      "including disrupted supply chains, challenges to monetary and \n",
      "financial stability that increasing climate change will \n",
      "present, and potential economic impact of rising risks to \n",
      "national security; is that a fair summary?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. That is a fair summary. And one of the lessons \n",
      "of large shocks is they get amplified as they come through the \n",
      "financial sector. Yes.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Litterman, the papers we have in \n",
      "front of us are littered with the ``systemic risk.'' It seems \n",
      "like a mild little term. Could you give us a sense of what its \n",
      "impact is?\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. The system risk that's incorporated in \n",
      "climate change comes from the uncertainty about how the economy \n",
      "is going to be responding to the various different hazards that \n",
      "are increasing. So, we have whole areas of the country that may \n",
      "be impacted by extreme weather, Florida, for instance, that \n",
      "could lead to significant financial stress in terms of the \n",
      "ability to raise funds for capital. So, you can have \n",
      "significant systemic impacts on the economy. It's ones of those \n",
      "things we just don't know.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. You said cascade through the economy.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Excuse me?\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Systemic meaning it cascades through \n",
      "the economy and the sectors.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Exactly. It will affect every aspect of the \n",
      "economy, including government budgets.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. And last question, you said you were \n",
      "hard-headed about your report. Explain?\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Yes, this is a report that was created by a \n",
      "bunch of scientists, academics, business people, investor, and \n",
      "we came to unanimous agreement. It wasn't about, I don't know, \n",
      "gut feeling. It was about facts. And the problem is we don't \n",
      "know what the future is going to bring, so we have to be \n",
      "prepared. It's very simple.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Good word to end on. I think my clock \n",
      "started a little bit late, so if the Ranking Member would like \n",
      "to go a little bit beyond that would be--all's fair. And I turn \n",
      "to Senator Grassley, Senator Padilla next, Senator Romney next, \n",
      "unless Senator Marshall returns.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Dr. Holtz-Eakin, our rising deficits are \n",
      "cast by a lot of people as long-term challenge, ``long-term \n",
      "challenge.'' Something we will have to deal with in the future, \n",
      "but not immediate problem today. Is that really the case or are \n",
      "we already living with the consequences of reckless spending \n",
      "and borrowing?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, I certainly believe the impacts are \n",
      "immediate and shouldn't be put off. Most people characterize \n",
      "the threat as something that looks like, you know, a Greece, \n",
      "Portugal sovereign meltdown that would happen somewhere in the \n",

      "mechanism I described in my opening remarks, the diminished \n",
      "productivity, the headwinds to raising the standard of living \n",
      "are going on in small amounts every single year.\n",
      "    It might be too tiny to notice in the moment, but \n",
      "cumulatively there are an enormous impact on our progress and \n",
      "so I think it's something that needs to be rectified \n",
      "immediately, both in and of itself, but also because it would \n",
      "allow the Congress more flexibility in pursuing other policy \n",
      "objectives.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Also to you, in last week's State of the \n",

      "himself as deficit reducer. He pointed to last year's $1.4 \n",
      "trillion deficit, which was lower than the 2002 deficits due to \n",
      "cessation by bipartisan pandemic relief. So, to you how would \n",
      "you rate the President's budgetary performance so far?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I think the Administration has done \n",
      "nothing to improve the budgetary outlook. Certainly, if you \n",
      "look back at 2021, the American Rescue Plan was an enormous \n",
      "policy error. Something I said at the time, so it's not 20/20 \n",
      "hindsight. It was a two trillion dollar stimulus in an economy \n",
      "that was growing at 6 percent. I was too big, was unnecessary, \n",
      "was poorly designed, lead to a lot of inflation, and this has \n",
      "been followed by several proposals called Build Back Better, \n",
      "but did not add up in any meaningful way and would have added \n",
      "to the core structural deficit in the United States.\n",

      "    Senator Grassley. Dr. Carney, in last week's State of the \n",
      "Union address, President Biden admitted that the U.S. will need \n",
      "oil and gas ``for a while.'' Your firm, Brookfield Asset \n",
      "Management, has invested in oil and gas infrastructure around \n",
      "the world. Do you believe that the U.S. Government should \n",

      "    Dr. Litterman. Well, sadly, the farmers have not been \n",

      "Carney. Two questions, Dr. Carney, as you make your assessment \n",
      "of climate, you talk a lot about carbon footprints. How do you \n",
      "assess the cradle to grave impacts of what you're looking at? \n",
      "How do you calculate the cost of implementing your policies? \n",
      "And I'm going to give you a ``for instance.''\n",
      "    So, like Iowa, Kansas, over 50 percent of our electricity \n",
      "is generated from wind. Unfortunately, wind energy is seven \n",
      "times more per kilowatt to produce than from natural gas. Solar \n",
      "is probably 70 times per kilowatt more than from natural gas. \n",
      "And then when we transport that electricity, transporting \n",
      "electricity is 10 times more expensive than transporting \n",
      "natural gas. So, we're exporting a lot of that wind generator \n",
      "electricity and the cost of generating it and transporting is--\n",
      "you know, do the math, 70, 100 times more expensive.\n",
      "    So, my question, going back to you, Dr. Carney, is how do \n",
      "you address the entire cradle to grave impact of your policies, \n",
      "not just the carbon footprint and how do you calculate the cost \n",
      "of implementing your plans?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Thank you. Chair just cut me off when I used up \n",
      "too much time. Very quickly, I might refrain cradle to grave, \n",

      "energy. I would point out that the levelized cost of wind and \n",
      "solar, new wind and solar is now comparable, if not through, in \n",
      "many jurisdictions. It is less expensive than natural gas is \n",
      "the first point.\n",
      "    The second point, and of course, subject to fewer price \n",
      "fluctuations in local and world markets. And then a quick \n",
      "point, if I may, just to pick up on the fiscal point, I'll just \n",
      "read into the record that one of the most effective mechanisms, \n",

      "brief moment to say that I appreciate the opportunity to serve \n",
      "on the Budget Committee as a new member and especially to do so \n",
      "at a time when the state of our federal budget is in such \n",
      "profound disrepair, perhaps more so than at any other time in \n",
      "our nation's history.\n",
      "    Fifteen years ago, our public debt measured as a percentage \n",
      "of the American economy, was at just 35 percent. Today it \n",
      "stands at 100 percent and according to fairly rosy projections \n",
      "within the next few decades it'll get up to 200 percent. And \n",
      "whether it's decades or just a few years away, we will reach a \n",
      "point where our interest on the national debt becomes the \n",
      "largest line item we have, bigger than Social Security or \n",
      "Medicare or Defense.\n",
      "    This fiscally irresponsible path that our federal budget is \n",

      "borne by the American public, if and when that crisis arrives \n",
      "in its full force.\n",
      "    Just last year the Congressional Budget Office noted that \n",
      "the very tangible consequences of our federal debt needed to be \n",
      "kept in mind or the high and rising federal debt that CBO \n",
      "projects over the next three decades would have serious \n",
      "consequences for the economy and federal budgeting, including \n",
      "the crowding out of private investment, higher interest costs, \n",

      "deficits and surging debt have been driven by and will continue \n",
      "to be driven by runaway profligate spending by the federal \n",

      "    Not only is this supremely misguided and shortsighted, but \n",
      "it's not remotely necessary. It certainly isn't desirable. The \n",
      "reality is that U.S. energy-related carbon emissions have been \n",
      "steadily declining over the last 15 years without any green new \n",
      "deal styled takeover of the federal budget and the American \n",

      "Deloitte Global Turning Point Report, which concluded that in \n",
      "2070 alone global GDP could be 7.6 percent lower compared to a \n",
      "baseline that does not account for climate change.\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I read that report--scanned that report \n",
      "when it first came out.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \n",
      "report from economists largely centralized in Cambridge, but \n",
      "from around the world that said that the effect on the U.S. \n",
      "economy would be more than $3 trillion in losses and GDP could \n",

      "with the CSTC Report that Litterman wrote. Correct?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. When it was released. Yes.\n",

      "sentence was ``Climate change poses a major risk to the \n",
      "stability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to \n",
      "sustain the American economy,'' is that correct?\n",

      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Not desirable.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Not desirable indeed. And then it also \n",
      "said, ``A central finding of this report is that climate change \n",
      "could pose systemic risks to the U.S. financial system across \n",
      "multiple sectors, geographies, and assets in the United States, \n",
      "sometimes simultaneously, and within a relatively short \n",
      "timeframe.'' Do you recall it saying that?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Not specifically, but I believe that.\n",

      "cause dramatic financial fluctuations and the stability of the \n",
      "system will be at risk. And then on the backside of your one-\n",

      "and we came to the unanimous conclusion that climate change \n",
      "poses significant risks to the American economy that must be \n",

      "    In the Agricultural sector, for example, we found that \n",

      "increase the range and virulence of pests and disrupt supply \n",

      "companies and governments.\n",
      "    One example, the CFTC Report, highlighted with the case of \n",
      "Pacific Gas and Electric in California which entered bankruptcy \n",

      "year to year, the costs from climate change are clearly growing \n",

      "    Dr. Holtz-Eaken. Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member \n",
      "Grassley, and members of the Committee, thank you for the \n",
      "privilege of being here today. Let me make three points quickly \n",
      "and then I look forward to the chance to answer your questions.\n",
      "    The first point is that climate change will have real \n",
      "impacts on the U.S. economy and these will worsen the federal \n",
      "budget outlook. Unquestionably, there will be additional \n",
      "outlays from the national flood insurance programs and other \n",
      "disaster crop risks kinds of programs and mandatory outlays. \n",
      "The Congress will probably chose to make some discretionary \n",
      "outlays in the future in response to the needs for mitigation \n",
      "and/or adaptation and these will worsen the budget picture, but \n",
      "the biggest impact is going to be lower revenue from an economy \n",
      "that grows more slowly over the long term and that the loss of \n",
      "some capital assets, diminished labor productivity, diminished \n",
      "productivity in agricultural lands will cumulatively reduce \n",
      "inflows to the federal budget.\n",
      "    The Congressional Budget Office recently took a look at \n",
      "this issue and concluded that the center point of set of \n",
      "estimates for the impact would be about a percentage point \n",
      "lower in GDP by 2051. And I would just point out that while \n",
      "that's a significant impact it's tantamount to under a tenth of \n",
      "a percentage point slower growth each and every year.\n",
      "    In contrast, and this point number two, the federal budget \n",
      "presents an immediate and much larger economic threat. We \n",
      "already have debt to GEP in the range of 100 percent and \n",
      "there's a large literature that stems from the work of Ken \n",
      "Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart indicates that countries in that \n",
      "range experience slower growth on the order of a percentage \n",
      "point per year because of their debt burdens. And the U.S. not \n",
      "only has entered that range it has a budget outlook which is \n",
      "unsustainable.\n",
      "    The CBO will put out a revised Economic and Budget Outlook \n",
      "this afternoon at 2 o'clock. It will doubtlessly look like the \n",
      "one they put out last year that shows spending expending \n",
      "revenues as far as the eye can see, driven by very rapid growth \n",
      "in the outlays in Medicare at 7 percent a year, Social Security \n",
      "at 6 percent a year, faster than any revenue source could \n",
      "possibly grow and as a result it will show debt relative to GDP \n",
      "rising as far as the eye can see. The interest costs of \n",
      "carrying that debt rising as far as can see and that is a \n",
      "mechanism which is a guarantee for slower growth in the future.\n",
      "    The point of the borrowing is not just the debt. The point \n",
      "is that that brings resources from the private sector into the \n",
      "government sector. And for every dollar you take from private \n",
      "investment and put into the best of federal infrastructure \n",
      "investments, you lose about 50 percent of the rate of return, \n",
      "so you're losing on every one of those borrowing activities, \n",
      "diminishing the productivity in the economy, lowering the \n",
      "standard of living for future workers in the next generations.\n",
      "    We really don't spend a lot of money on investments in this \n",
      "program and more than likely we're going to take that money \n",
      "from a private investment and put it into a consumption \n",
      "expenditure. That's the point of Social Security and Medicare \n",
      "is to raise the standard of living in retirement for seniors. \n",
      "There's no rate of return to consumption investment, so the \n",
      "federal budget is the biggest headwind to economic growth \n",
      "because it is stacked against investing in the future and needs \n",
      "to be brought into some sort sustainable alignment in order to \n",
      "stop these headwinds to growth.\n",
      "    The other point that's going on in the federal budget is \n",
      "that the mandatory expenditures are crowding out discretionary \n",
      "spending. Discretionary spending is where we do national \n",
      "security, basic research, infrastructure, education, all the \n",
      "places where you can invest in the future of the country and \n",
      "those opportunities are getting squeezed out by the growth of \n",
      "these mandatory programs.\n",
      "    So, point number three, not only would getting the budget \n",
      "on a sustainable trajectory improve the economic outlook, it \n",
      "would free up the budget resources through investments, \n",
      "especially investments in the climate mitigation and adaptation \n",
      "that are so important to this Committee and to this hearing.\n",
      "    And so, I can't think of a single bigger accomplishment \n",
      "than for this Committee and the U.S. Congress to finally come \n",
      "to grips with the federal budget outlook and its \n",
      "unsustainability. It lies at the crossroads of all the threats \n",
      "to our future and needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.\n",
      "    I thank you for the chance to be here today. I look forward \n",
      "to your questions.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I'll lead \n",
      "and then Senator Romney is next in line.\n",
      "    Dr. Carney, you've held two of the most significant and \n",
      "powerful positions global in the banking sector. Climate change \n",
      "was not customarily a part of the banking sector's interest. \n",
      "Why is it that you took such an interest I addressing climate \n",
      "change?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Chair. It goes back, in part, to \n",
      "your opening comments, some of the points you made in your \n",
      "opening comments, which is that under-investing in resilience \n",
      "upfront leads to much greater costs down the road. And it was \n",
      "particular when I became Governor at the Bank of England and \n",
      "it's not commonly known, but one of the responsibilities of the \n",
      "Bank of England is to oversee the insurance industry and it's \n",
      "the fourth largest insurance industry in the world. It includes \n",
      "one of the largest, if not the largest, re-insurance market, \n",
      "the famous Lords of London, and so therefore that's a property \n",
      "in casualty and re-insurance industry that's directly affected \n",
      "by climate change.\n",
      "    And one of the lessons that the brokers and the risk \n",
      "managers in Lord of London had determined was that the tail \n",
      "risk of the past were becoming the central scenario of the \n",
      "future. I'll refer to Dr. Litterman's comments about one in a \n",
      "hundred risk events becoming that much more frequent. So, of \n",
      "course they're adjusting pricing. They're adjusting coverage \n",
      "which as real implications for economies and it's apparent to \n",
      "us, as risk managers, that this will affect the economy more \n",
      "broadly and the financial system potentially more broadly if \n",
      "there is not adequate information to assess the potential \n",
      "degree of those risks. And if risk managers don't at least have \n",
      "the opportunity to determine whether or not they will take \n",
      "steps----\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Carney, you were in charge of the \n",
      "Bank of Canada after the 2008 financial crisis. Can you compare \n",
      "what you foresee with respect to climate with what you \n",
      "experienced in the 2008 mortgage crisis?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Well, there's two things that I would say. The \n",
      "first is that one of the experiences of that crisis, and many \n",
      "of the members, of course, lived through it and helped managed \n",
      "through it, is what's called a Minsky moment, a realization \n",
      "that basic assumptions were no longer true. For example, that \n",
      "health prices would never fall in the United States, that \n",
      "capital was money good, that assets off balance sheets would \n",
      "stay off balance sheets, all of those proved false and lead to \n",
      "the collapse or virtual collapse of the core, much of the core \n",
      "of the financial system with huge economic costs that \n",
      "ultimately have added to the debt burden of the United States, \n",
      "amongst other countries.\n",
      "    Now, in Canada, we were more fortunate for a variety of \n",
      "reasons, but one of the reasons was we had put more resilience \n",
      "into our financial institutions upfront.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. I'm not getting into Canada \n",
      "specifically. I'm looking between what you project potentially \n",
      "happening with the climate crisis. What's the scale comparison, \n",
      "in your mind, between what we experienced with the 2008 \n",
      "financial crisis and what climate portends for our systems?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Okay, so I'll just lead from that point. The \n",
      "first point is what we want to avoid is a rapid and sudden \n",
      "adjustment to the climate crisis, both adaptation, the impact \n",
      "of fiscal damage or belated investments to address the issue. \n",
      "The orders of magnitude are potentially similar in those cases \n",
      "if we delay adjustment.\n",
      "    If we adjust upfront, actually, I'm of the view that we can \n",
      "actually grow economies through the investments which would \n",
      "improve competitiveness. But if we delay it until it's evident, \n",
      "and this is the tragedy of the horizon supremely evident to \n",
      "everybody, then the orders of magnitude approaches the \n",
      "financial crisis.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. And just to be clear, your testimony \n",
      "is that climate change could reduce the level of global GDP per \n",
      "capita by 10 to 20 percent and in that calculation you leave \n",
      "out critical economic channels that have not been modeled, \n",
      "including disrupted supply chains, challenges to monetary and \n",
      "financial stability that increasing climate change will \n",
      "present, and potential economic impact of rising risks to \n",
      "national security; is that a fair summary?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. That is a fair summary. And one of the lessons \n",
      "of large shocks is they get amplified as they come through the \n",
      "financial sector. Yes.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Litterman, the papers we have in \n",
      "front of us are littered with the ``systemic risk.'' It seems \n",
      "like a mild little term. Could you give us a sense of what its \n",
      "impact is?\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. The system risk that's incorporated in \n",
      "climate change comes from the uncertainty about how the economy \n",
      "is going to be responding to the various different hazards that \n",
      "are increasing. So, we have whole areas of the country that may \n",
      "be impacted by extreme weather, Florida, for instance, that \n",
      "could lead to significant financial stress in terms of the \n",
      "ability to raise funds for capital. So, you can have \n",
      "significant systemic impacts on the economy. It's ones of those \n",
      "things we just don't know.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. You said cascade through the economy.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Excuse me?\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Systemic meaning it cascades through \n",
      "the economy and the sectors.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Exactly. It will affect every aspect of the \n",
      "economy, including government budgets.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. And last question, you said you were \n",
      "hard-headed about your report. Explain?\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Yes, this is a report that was created by a \n",
      "bunch of scientists, academics, business people, investor, and \n",
      "we came to unanimous agreement. It wasn't about, I don't know, \n",
      "gut feeling. It was about facts. And the problem is we don't \n",
      "know what the future is going to bring, so we have to be \n",
      "prepared. It's very simple.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Good word to end on. I think my clock \n",
      "started a little bit late, so if the Ranking Member would like \n",
      "to go a little bit beyond that would be--all's fair. And I turn \n",
      "to Senator Grassley, Senator Padilla next, Senator Romney next, \n",
      "unless Senator Marshall returns.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Dr. Holtz-Eakin, our rising deficits are \n",
      "cast by a lot of people as long-term challenge, ``long-term \n",
      "challenge.'' Something we will have to deal with in the future, \n",
      "but not immediate problem today. Is that really the case or are \n",
      "we already living with the consequences of reckless spending \n",
      "and borrowing?\n",

      "of climate, you talk a lot about carbon footprints. How do you \n",
      "assess the cradle to grave impacts of what you're looking at? \n",
      "How do you calculate the cost of implementing your policies? \n",
      "And I'm going to give you a ``for instance.''\n",
      "    So, like Iowa, Kansas, over 50 percent of our electricity \n",
      "is generated from wind. Unfortunately, wind energy is seven \n",
      "times more per kilowatt to produce than from natural gas. Solar \n",
      "is probably 70 times per kilowatt more than from natural gas. \n",
      "And then when we transport that electricity, transporting \n",
      "electricity is 10 times more expensive than transporting \n",
      "natural gas. So, we're exporting a lot of that wind generator \n",
      "electricity and the cost of generating it and transporting is--\n",
      "you know, do the math, 70, 100 times more expensive.\n",
      "    So, my question, going back to you, Dr. Carney, is how do \n",
      "you address the entire cradle to grave impact of your policies, \n",
      "not just the carbon footprint and how do you calculate the cost \n",
      "of implementing your plans?\n",

      "energy. I would point out that the levelized cost of wind and \n",
      "solar, new wind and solar is now comparable, if not through, in \n",
      "many jurisdictions. It is less expensive than natural gas is \n",
      "the first point.\n",

      "fluctuations in local and world markets. And then a quick \n",
      "point, if I may, just to pick up on the fiscal point, I'll just \n",
      "read into the record that one of the most effective mechanisms, \n",
      "and the Chair referenced this at the start, is credible climate \n",

      "of the hearing this morning. We have multiple hearings going on \n",
      "and so you will be getting attendance sporadically from a \n",

      "welcome our new members to what I hope will be a busy, revived, \n",
      "impactful, and lively Budget Committee.\n",
      "    I want this to be your surprise favorite committee. We have \n",

      "    Dr. Holtz-Eaken. Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member \n",
      "Grassley, and members of the Committee, thank you for the \n",
      "privilege of being here today. Let me make three points quickly \n",
      "and then I look forward to the chance to answer your questions.\n",
      "    The first point is that climate change will have real \n",
      "impacts on the U.S. economy and these will worsen the federal \n",
      "budget outlook. Unquestionably, there will be additional \n",
      "outlays from the national flood insurance programs and other \n",
      "disaster crop risks kinds of programs and mandatory outlays. \n",
      "The Congress will probably chose to make some discretionary \n",
      "outlays in the future in response to the needs for mitigation \n",
      "and/or adaptation and these will worsen the budget picture, but \n",
      "the biggest impact is going to be lower revenue from an economy \n",
      "that grows more slowly over the long term and that the loss of \n",
      "some capital assets, diminished labor productivity, diminished \n",
      "productivity in agricultural lands will cumulatively reduce \n",
      "inflows to the federal budget.\n",
      "    The Congressional Budget Office recently took a look at \n",
      "this issue and concluded that the center point of set of \n",
      "estimates for the impact would be about a percentage point \n",
      "lower in GDP by 2051. And I would just point out that while \n",
      "that's a significant impact it's tantamount to under a tenth of \n",
      "a percentage point slower growth each and every year.\n",
      "    In contrast, and this point number two, the federal budget \n",
      "presents an immediate and much larger economic threat. We \n",
      "already have debt to GEP in the range of 100 percent and \n",
      "there's a large literature that stems from the work of Ken \n",
      "Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart indicates that countries in that \n",
      "range experience slower growth on the order of a percentage \n",
      "point per year because of their debt burdens. And the U.S. not \n",
      "only has entered that range it has a budget outlook which is \n",
      "unsustainable.\n",
      "    The CBO will put out a revised Economic and Budget Outlook \n",
      "this afternoon at 2 o'clock. It will doubtlessly look like the \n",
      "one they put out last year that shows spending expending \n",
      "revenues as far as the eye can see, driven by very rapid growth \n",
      "in the outlays in Medicare at 7 percent a year, Social Security \n",
      "at 6 percent a year, faster than any revenue source could \n",
      "possibly grow and as a result it will show debt relative to GDP \n",
      "rising as far as the eye can see. The interest costs of \n",
      "carrying that debt rising as far as can see and that is a \n",
      "mechanism which is a guarantee for slower growth in the future.\n",
      "    The point of the borrowing is not just the debt. The point \n",
      "is that that brings resources from the private sector into the \n",
      "government sector. And for every dollar you take from private \n",
      "investment and put into the best of federal infrastructure \n",
      "investments, you lose about 50 percent of the rate of return, \n",
      "so you're losing on every one of those borrowing activities, \n",
      "diminishing the productivity in the economy, lowering the \n",
      "standard of living for future workers in the next generations.\n",
      "    We really don't spend a lot of money on investments in this \n",
      "program and more than likely we're going to take that money \n",
      "from a private investment and put it into a consumption \n",
      "expenditure. That's the point of Social Security and Medicare \n",
      "is to raise the standard of living in retirement for seniors. \n",
      "There's no rate of return to consumption investment, so the \n",
      "federal budget is the biggest headwind to economic growth \n",
      "because it is stacked against investing in the future and needs \n",
      "to be brought into some sort sustainable alignment in order to \n",
      "stop these headwinds to growth.\n",
      "    The other point that's going on in the federal budget is \n",
      "that the mandatory expenditures are crowding out discretionary \n",
      "spending. Discretionary spending is where we do national \n",
      "security, basic research, infrastructure, education, all the \n",
      "places where you can invest in the future of the country and \n",
      "those opportunities are getting squeezed out by the growth of \n",
      "these mandatory programs.\n",
      "    So, point number three, not only would getting the budget \n",
      "on a sustainable trajectory improve the economic outlook, it \n",
      "would free up the budget resources through investments, \n",
      "especially investments in the climate mitigation and adaptation \n",
      "that are so important to this Committee and to this hearing.\n",
      "    And so, I can't think of a single bigger accomplishment \n",
      "than for this Committee and the U.S. Congress to finally come \n",
      "to grips with the federal budget outlook and its \n",
      "unsustainability. It lies at the crossroads of all the threats \n",
      "to our future and needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.\n",
      "    I thank you for the chance to be here today. I look forward \n",
      "to your questions.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I'll lead \n",
      "and then Senator Romney is next in line.\n",
      "    Dr. Carney, you've held two of the most significant and \n",
      "powerful positions global in the banking sector. Climate change \n",
      "was not customarily a part of the banking sector's interest. \n",
      "Why is it that you took such an interest I addressing climate \n",
      "change?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Chair. It goes back, in part, to \n",
      "your opening comments, some of the points you made in your \n",
      "opening comments, which is that under-investing in resilience \n",
      "upfront leads to much greater costs down the road. And it was \n",
      "particular when I became Governor at the Bank of England and \n",
      "it's not commonly known, but one of the responsibilities of the \n",
      "Bank of England is to oversee the insurance industry and it's \n",
      "the fourth largest insurance industry in the world. It includes \n",
      "one of the largest, if not the largest, re-insurance market, \n",
      "the famous Lords of London, and so therefore that's a property \n",
      "in casualty and re-insurance industry that's directly affected \n",
      "by climate change.\n",
      "    And one of the lessons that the brokers and the risk \n",
      "managers in Lord of London had determined was that the tail \n",
      "risk of the past were becoming the central scenario of the \n",
      "future. I'll refer to Dr. Litterman's comments about one in a \n",
      "hundred risk events becoming that much more frequent. So, of \n",
      "course they're adjusting pricing. They're adjusting coverage \n",
      "which as real implications for economies and it's apparent to \n",
      "us, as risk managers, that this will affect the economy more \n",
      "broadly and the financial system potentially more broadly if \n",
      "there is not adequate information to assess the potential \n",
      "degree of those risks. And if risk managers don't at least have \n",
      "the opportunity to determine whether or not they will take \n",
      "steps----\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Carney, you were in charge of the \n",
      "Bank of Canada after the 2008 financial crisis. Can you compare \n",
      "what you foresee with respect to climate with what you \n",
      "experienced in the 2008 mortgage crisis?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Well, there's two things that I would say. The \n",
      "first is that one of the experiences of that crisis, and many \n",
      "of the members, of course, lived through it and helped managed \n",
      "through it, is what's called a Minsky moment, a realization \n",
      "that basic assumptions were no longer true. For example, that \n",
      "health prices would never fall in the United States, that \n",
      "capital was money good, that assets off balance sheets would \n",
      "stay off balance sheets, all of those proved false and lead to \n",
      "the collapse or virtual collapse of the core, much of the core \n",
      "of the financial system with huge economic costs that \n",
      "ultimately have added to the debt burden of the United States, \n",
      "amongst other countries.\n",
      "    Now, in Canada, we were more fortunate for a variety of \n",
      "reasons, but one of the reasons was we had put more resilience \n",
      "into our financial institutions upfront.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. I'm not getting into Canada \n",
      "specifically. I'm looking between what you project potentially \n",
      "happening with the climate crisis. What's the scale comparison, \n",
      "in your mind, between what we experienced with the 2008 \n",
      "financial crisis and what climate portends for our systems?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Okay, so I'll just lead from that point. The \n",
      "first point is what we want to avoid is a rapid and sudden \n",
      "adjustment to the climate crisis, both adaptation, the impact \n",
      "of fiscal damage or belated investments to address the issue. \n",
      "The orders of magnitude are potentially similar in those cases \n",
      "if we delay adjustment.\n",
      "    If we adjust upfront, actually, I'm of the view that we can \n",
      "actually grow economies through the investments which would \n",
      "improve competitiveness. But if we delay it until it's evident, \n",
      "and this is the tragedy of the horizon supremely evident to \n",
      "everybody, then the orders of magnitude approaches the \n",
      "financial crisis.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. And just to be clear, your testimony \n",
      "is that climate change could reduce the level of global GDP per \n",
      "capita by 10 to 20 percent and in that calculation you leave \n",
      "out critical economic channels that have not been modeled, \n",
      "including disrupted supply chains, challenges to monetary and \n",
      "financial stability that increasing climate change will \n",
      "present, and potential economic impact of rising risks to \n",
      "national security; is that a fair summary?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. That is a fair summary. And one of the lessons \n",
      "of large shocks is they get amplified as they come through the \n",
      "financial sector. Yes.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Litterman, the papers we have in \n",
      "front of us are littered with the ``systemic risk.'' It seems \n",
      "like a mild little term. Could you give us a sense of what its \n",
      "impact is?\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. The system risk that's incorporated in \n",
      "climate change comes from the uncertainty about how the economy \n",
      "is going to be responding to the various different hazards that \n",
      "are increasing. So, we have whole areas of the country that may \n",
      "be impacted by extreme weather, Florida, for instance, that \n",
      "could lead to significant financial stress in terms of the \n",
      "ability to raise funds for capital. So, you can have \n",
      "significant systemic impacts on the economy. It's ones of those \n",
      "things we just don't know.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. You said cascade through the economy.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Excuse me?\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Systemic meaning it cascades through \n",
      "the economy and the sectors.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Exactly. It will affect every aspect of the \n",
      "economy, including government budgets.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. And last question, you said you were \n",
      "hard-headed about your report. Explain?\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Yes, this is a report that was created by a \n",
      "bunch of scientists, academics, business people, investor, and \n",
      "we came to unanimous agreement. It wasn't about, I don't know, \n",
      "gut feeling. It was about facts. And the problem is we don't \n",
      "know what the future is going to bring, so we have to be \n",
      "prepared. It's very simple.\n",
      "    Chairman Whitehouse. Good word to end on. I think my clock \n",
      "started a little bit late, so if the Ranking Member would like \n",
      "to go a little bit beyond that would be--all's fair. And I turn \n",
      "to Senator Grassley, Senator Padilla next, Senator Romney next, \n",
      "unless Senator Marshall returns.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Dr. Holtz-Eakin, our rising deficits are \n",
      "cast by a lot of people as long-term challenge, ``long-term \n",
      "challenge.'' Something we will have to deal with in the future, \n",
      "but not immediate problem today. Is that really the case or are \n",
      "we already living with the consequences of reckless spending \n",
      "and borrowing?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, I certainly believe the impacts are \n",
      "immediate and shouldn't be put off. Most people characterize \n",
      "the threat as something that looks like, you know, a Greece, \n",
      "Portugal sovereign meltdown that would happen somewhere in the \n",
      "future if we just did nothing, but the reality is that the \n",
      "mechanism I described in my opening remarks, the diminished \n",
      "productivity, the headwinds to raising the standard of living \n",
      "are going on in small amounts every single year.\n",
      "    It might be too tiny to notice in the moment, but \n",
      "cumulatively there are an enormous impact on our progress and \n",
      "so I think it's something that needs to be rectified \n",
      "immediately, both in and of itself, but also because it would \n",
      "allow the Congress more flexibility in pursuing other policy \n",
      "objectives.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Also to you, in last week's State of the \n",
      "Union address, the President once again tried to portray \n",
      "himself as deficit reducer. He pointed to last year's $1.4 \n",
      "trillion deficit, which was lower than the 2002 deficits due to \n",
      "cessation by bipartisan pandemic relief. So, to you how would \n",
      "you rate the President's budgetary performance so far?\n",
      "    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I think the Administration has done \n",
      "nothing to improve the budgetary outlook. Certainly, if you \n",
      "look back at 2021, the American Rescue Plan was an enormous \n",
      "policy error. Something I said at the time, so it's not 20/20 \n",
      "hindsight. It was a two trillion dollar stimulus in an economy \n",
      "that was growing at 6 percent. I was too big, was unnecessary, \n",
      "was poorly designed, lead to a lot of inflation, and this has \n",
      "been followed by several proposals called Build Back Better, \n",
      "but did not add up in any meaningful way and would have added \n",
      "to the core structural deficit in the United States.\n",
      "    He's taken administrative actions for hundreds of billions \n",
      "of dollars in student loan relief that are difficult for me to \n",
      "defend, so I don't see any activities being taken by the \n",
      "Administration that are recognizing the problems that federal \n",
      "budget faces and we need some leadership on that front.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Dr. Carney, in last week's State of the \n",
      "Union address, President Biden admitted that the U.S. will need \n",
      "oil and gas ``for a while.'' Your firm, Brookfield Asset \n",
      "Management, has invested in oil and gas infrastructure around \n",
      "the world. Do you believe that the U.S. Government should \n",
      "mandate private institutions divest from their fossil fuel \n",
      "interests, and if so, what immediate impact would this have on \n",
      "the average American?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. The first thing, I agree with the President and \n",
      "the timeline in continued need for fossil fuel. Secondly, I'll \n",
      "just note Brookfield is one of the largest investors in \n",
      "renewables and operators of renewables in the world. Thirdly, \n",
      "no, I don't believe and I've never advocated mandatory \n",
      "divestment of fossil fuels assets. In fact, to address the \n",
      "climate challenge what is necessary to get capital financing to \n",
      "where the emissions are and ensure that businesses can invest \n",
      "to get those emissions down and that's been a consistent \n",
      "position I've had for more than a decade.\n",
      "    Senator Grassley. Yes. I don't have a question, but you \n",
      "said--even though I have 1 and 12 seconds left, I'd like to \n",
      "just make a statement, but it's kind of a question for \n",
      "information from Dr. Litterman and Dr. Carney and it deals with \n",
      "the ESG movements within finance, within banking. And I know \n",
      "you don't have to invest where you don't want to invest, but as \n",
      "a family farmer in Iowa and my son, Robin, runs the family \n",
      "farm, but we're corn/soybean farmers.\n",
      "    So, let's just assume that the FDIC or some other regulator \n",
      "or bank say to the community bank in Parkersburg, Iowa that \n",
      "you've got to make sure that you know what the carbon footprint \n",
      "is of the farmer and in 60 years of arming I don't know where \n",
      "to start to answer that question. And then I think--so what is \n",
      "obligation that banker is under an obligation to get that \n",
      "information from me, but if the farmer can't give the \n",
      "information how does it get out? So this is what I'm thinking \n",
      "as a historic farming. When I started farming in 1960, we'd \n",
      "make 10 trips across the field and produce maybe 60 bushel of \n",
      "corn to the acre.\n",
      "    Today with minimum tillage or no tillage, we make about \n",
      "three or four trips across and we produce--in Iowa, I think the \n",
      "average farmer produced 204 bushels of corn to acre. So, you \n",
      "can see that farmers are already producing unit of food with a \n",
      "lot less units of energy than they used to and do we get any \n",
      "credit for that? I mean we've already been helping the global \n",
      "warming issue with more efficient farming and all that. But \n",
      "that banker in Parkersburg can say to Chuck Grassley you tell \n",
      "us what your carbon footprint is.\n",
      "    Dr. Litterman. Senator, it's not an issue of reporting what \n",
      "your carbon footprint is. We don't have to be aware of what the \n",
      "carbon flux out of the atmosphere into the ground is and \n",
      "there's tremendous opportunity for farmers to actually address \n",
      "this problem, to sequester carbon into their soil so they can \n",
      "change the way they farm. But we do have to address the \n",
      "problem. We have to measure the carbon. We have to understand \n",
      "the science. There's a tremendous opportunity in farming, in \n",
      "ranching, and in timberlands to address this problem and I hope \n",

      "of climate, you talk a lot about carbon footprints. How do you \n",
      "assess the cradle to grave impacts of what you're looking at? \n",
      "How do you calculate the cost of implementing your policies? \n",
      "And I'm going to give you a ``for instance.''\n",
      "    So, like Iowa, Kansas, over 50 percent of our electricity \n",
      "is generated from wind. Unfortunately, wind energy is seven \n",
      "times more per kilowatt to produce than from natural gas. Solar \n",
      "is probably 70 times per kilowatt more than from natural gas. \n",
      "And then when we transport that electricity, transporting \n",
      "electricity is 10 times more expensive than transporting \n",
      "natural gas. So, we're exporting a lot of that wind generator \n",
      "electricity and the cost of generating it and transporting is--\n",
      "you know, do the math, 70, 100 times more expensive.\n",
      "    So, my question, going back to you, Dr. Carney, is how do \n",
      "you address the entire cradle to grave impact of your policies, \n",
      "not just the carbon footprint and how do you calculate the cost \n",
      "of implementing your plans?\n",
      "    Dr. Carney. Thank you. Chair just cut me off when I used up \n",
      "too much time. Very quickly, I might refrain cradle to grave, \n",

      "energy. I would point out that the levelized cost of wind and \n",
      "solar, new wind and solar is now comparable, if not through, in \n",
      "many jurisdictions. It is less expensive than natural gas is \n",
      "the first point.\n",
      "    The second point, and of course, subject to fewer price \n",
      "fluctuations in local and world markets. And then a quick \n",
      "point, if I may, just to pick up on the fiscal point, I'll just \n",
      "read into the record that one of the most effective mechanisms, \n",
      "and the Chair referenced this at the start, is credible climate \n",
      "policy that would include regulation. And when you combine that \n",
      "with the financial sector and businesses having the right \n",
      "information, you get the investment in technologies that are \n",
      "efficient today, cost effective, and in the types of \n",
      "innovations that will be necessary tomorrow. And I'll just \n",

      "    Dr. Litterman. Sure. Insurance companies base their pricing \n",

      "longer relevant. We are in a new weather environment now and so \n",
      "we see these tail events happening much more frequently than \n",

      "raise the premium, but the insurance regulators won't allow \n",
      "them to raise the premium because based on what they say. Show \n",
      "me the data. Well, the data is changing every day. These things \n",
      "are becoming more and more likely and so the insurance markets \n",
      "are not working. Reinsurers understand this. They see the risks \n",
      "and they say we won't underwrite these losses because we see \n",
      "them coming and so these markets are just not working.\n",
      "    And then you get Florida, the federal government says we'll \n",
      "provide the flood insurance. California says taxpayers will \n",
      "underwrite the costs of fire insurance. This leads to incorrect \n",

I am delighted to kick off the first \\nBudget Committee hearing of this year by welcoming Ranking \\nMember Grassley, who I serve with also on the Finance and \\nJudiciary Committees, so we have a lot of experience together \\nand I'm very happy that he's the Ranking Member.\\n    I want to welcome all the colleagues who will be in and out \\nof the hearing this morning. We have multiple hearings going on \\nand so you will be getting attendance sporadically from a \\nconsiderable number of our members. I want to particularly \\nwelcome our new members to what I hope will be a busy, revived, \\nimpactful, and lively Budget Committee.\\n    I want this to be your surprise favorite committee. We have \\nimportant work to do on bipartisan healthcare reforms, on \\nreforming this Committee's process to fit the basic arithmetic \\nof the budget and on issues important to each of you as \\nmembers.\\n    We're going to begin with a series of hearings on the \\nlooming costs and economic risks of climate upheaval. Almost \\nexactly five years ago, I sent around this binder to all of my \\nSenate colleagues in which I complied some of the compelling \\nwarnings about the economic risks associated with climate \\nchange.\\n    Last week I sent your staffs an updated version of the \\nbinder. Here it is. As you can see, the warnings keep piling \\nup. Have fun with the light reading. These warnings come from \\ncentral bankers, economists, assets managers, insurance \\ncompanies, investment banks, credit rating agencies, and \\nleading management consultations. Folks with a lot of \\ncredibility when it comes to economics, finance, corporate \\nrisks and their effects on government spending and revenues. \\nThese will be our witnesses, economists, scientists, business \\nleaders, and other financial and risk experts, many of whose \\nwork in this binder.\\n    I've said that science provides the headlights for society. \\nThat it's scientists who illuminate the way for us to navigate \\ninto the future. Think of the economists and scientists we'll \\nhear from as the headlights for the United States Congress as \\nthis Committee helps navigate our long-term budget and fiscal \\npriorities.\\n    Look at our national debt. One thing that stands is how \\nmuch of it was incurred as a result of exogenous shots to the \\neconomy. Consider the 2008 financial crisis which blew up the \\nfinancial security of families and businesses across the \\ncountry and reduced government revenues for a decade. Two years \\nafter the recession, CBO found that projected revenues fell by \\n$4.4 trillion and projected spending rose by $800 billion to \\nspur that recovery.\\n    Consider the pandemic. The Committee for a Responsible \\nFederal Budget estimates that the federal response to the \\npandemic which brought COVID under control, protected families, \\nand jumpstarted our economy recovery will add $5.5 trillion to \\nour deficits. That doesn't factor in lost revenue or lost \\neconomic activity, so the total economic cost is actually \\nhigher.\\n    We came through both. But together those two exogenous \\nshocks contributed $10 trillion to the federal debt, more than \\n40 percent of the total, proof of how catastrophic events can \\nand do effect the federal budget and the economy and how life \\nhas a way of upsetting best laid plans and 10-year budget \\nbaselines.\\n    Headlights and better attention to what they illuminated \\ncould've help. Plenty of financial experts saw the 2008 \\nmortgage mess coming. Plenty of epidemiologist warned that the \\ncountry was woefully unprepared for a pandemic.\\n    Now, we have all these warnings. Warnings of crashes in \\ncoastal property values as rising seas and more powerful storms \\nhit the 30-year mortgage horizon. Warnings of insurance \\ncollapse from more frequent, intense, and unpredictable \\nwildfires. A dangers interplay between the insurance and \\nmortgage markets hitting real estate markets across the \\ncountry.\\n    Inflation from decreased agricultural yields, massive \\ninfrastructure demand, trouble in municipal bond markets, \\nstranded assets, and a carbon bubble. The most dangerous risks \\nare called systemic. We mean that they will cascade out into \\nthe broader economy as the mortgage problem did in 2008, and \\nit's big. It predicts the differential between being \\nresponsible and reckless about climate could come to more $220 \\ntrillion, globally, between now and 2070.\\n    Some of these warn of risks are already upon us. Already \\nclimate-related national disasters increase federal spending on \\ndisaster assistance, flood insurance, crop insurance, and other \\nprograms we fund. But this is just the beginning. It will \\ncertainly get worse, much worse particularly if warming exceeds \\n1.5 degrees. We are on a bad trajectory. It's time for us all \\nto wake up and face the problem before coastal cities flood \\nwith water or southwest cities can't get water. I hope we can \\nfinish that off with action if we snap into focus on the \\ndanger.\\n    We're all familiar with the tragedy of the Commons. In \\n2015, our opening witness, Dr. Carney, gave a speech entitled \\nThe Tragedy of the Horizon because some of the gravest dangers \\nof climate change, which we could head off today, come to past \\nyears or decades out. Ryan's coastline will be gone, reshaped \\ninto an Acapulco by 2100.\\n    You say, ah, who cares? What's that? It's an eternity. \\nWell, almost exactly a year ago I became a grandfather for the \\nfirst time. Baby Vera, God willing, will be alive in 2100. When \\nI look at her, I'm looking at that future. Walk by any \\nelementary school, the faces you see on the playground, God \\nwilling, will be alive in 2100. How will those little ones \\nremember our less than greatest generation? We owe it to kids \\non playgrounds all across America to pay attention to get this \\nright.\\n    By the end of this series of hearings, if we hear these \\nexpert witnesses, if we treat their testimony as our \\nheadlights, then our path, I hope, will be clear. Thank you and \\nlet's get to work.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. I turn to my Ranking Member, Senator \\nGrassley.\",\n",
       " 'OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR GRASSLEY \\\\2\\\\': \"---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Prepared statement of Senator Grassley appears in the appendix \\non page 36.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Senator Grassley. Senator Whitehouse, I compliment you on \\nyour leadership on this Committee and look forward to the two \\nyears ahead. I'm pleased to be here with all of you as Ranking \\nMember. Despite our political differences, and they aren't as \\ngreat as the public believes between Republicans and the \\nDemocrats, and particularly between Grassley and Whitehouse. I \\nknow that we can find common areas of agreement to work on \\ntogether.\\n    One area of agreement must be that our budget and \\nappropriation process is broken. This sentiment isn't new at \\nall nor is it particularly partisan. No person could look at \\nlast year's process and say that things are working. For Fiscal \\nYear 2023, Congress didn't adopt a budget. The Senate \\nAppropriations Committee didn't mark up a single bill and not \\none of the 12 individual appropriation bills was debated in the \\nSenate floor.\\n    Instead, we were presented with a $1.7 trillion omnibus \\njust a few days before Congress. Things need to change. Now, \\nmaybe we shouldn't be surprised because when the Senate goes \\ninto session at 3 o'clock on Monday and has one vote, hardly \\nany business, and then you work all day Tuesday and all day \\nWednesday and adjourn at 1:45 on Thursday, you can't get a lot \\nof session work done when you are just in session two and a \\nhalf weeks compared to when I came to the United States Senate \\nstarted no later than noon on Monday, debated on Monday, \\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, went home Friday at 4:00. So, I \\nthink there needs to be some reanalysis of the work that we're \\nputting--I mean not the work because there's plenty of work for \\nsenators, but the amount of time that we're in session.\\n    I want to applaud two leaders in this process, Senator \\nMurray and Collins, for publicly announcing their commitment to \\nregular order, including debating appropriation bills on the \\nSenate floor. We need to do our part to make that happen. We \\nshould also agree that our nation's fiscal outlook is dire.\\n    The Congressional Budget Office will release an updated \\nbudget projection this afternoon. Every indication is that \\ntheir new projections will be as bad as or worse than last \\nsummer's projection. This is what they told us last summer. \\nWithin 10 years, public debt, as a share of our economy, will \\nexceed World War II record highs. However, unlike after World \\nWar II, when spending and debt subsided, our public debt is \\nprojected to climb even higher.\\n    Our public debt will reach 110 percent of our economy in \\n2032 and grow to 185 percent by 2052. Trillion-dollar annual \\ndeficits will be replaced by two trillion deficits within a few \\nyears. Simply serving the debt will lead record-breaking annual \\ncosts of more than $1 trillion within 10 years.\\n    So, Mr. Chairman, your immediate predecessor refused to \\nbring in CBO to discuss the overall budget outlook. This was a \\nmistake. So, I urge under your leadership to hold a hearing \\nwith CBO on the latest outlook. Nobody benefits from just \\nburying our heads in the sand. I acknowledge that a changing \\nclimate is a historic and scientific fact. I also recognize \\nthat most scientists agree man-made emissions contribute to \\nclimate change.\\n    Throughout my career, I've advocated for renewable and \\nalternative energy solutions. Being the father of the Wind \\nEnergy Tax Credit in 1992, I think maybe I was doing that 10 \\nyears before climate change was much of an issue. And so, today \\nin Iowa we get 60 percent of our electricity from wind and in \\nfour years American Energy, Des Moines, Iowa, will be getting \\n80 percent, 85 percent maybe more accurately, of their energy \\nfrom wind.\\n    This being said, even if the entire U.S. stopped emitting \\ngreenhouse gas tomorrow, projected temperatures would only be \\nthree-tenths degrees Fahrenheit lower come 2100. Even in this \\nunrealistic scenario, the U.S. would still need major polluters \\nlike China and India to pull their weight. As we look to \\naddress climate and energy issues, the nation must also address \\nour fiscal health.\\n    There's plenty of blame to go around for how we got into \\nour current situation. Republican or Democrats have to share \\nthis blame. For decades, Congress turned a blind eye as our \\nnation walked toward a fiscal cliff, but Democrats turned that \\nwalk into a sprint. In March 2021, Democrats to advantage an \\nemergency situation to pass a $2 trillion partisan spending \\nbill, even as our economy showed strong signs of recovery. Then \\nas inflation started to a 40-year high, they doubled down \\nspending trillions more on their liberal wish list.\\n    They pushed through omnibus appropriation bills with take \\nit or leave mantra for two years. Each time growing the size of \\nthe government when not using fast-track procedures or \\ngovernment shutdown as leverage, the Administration drove \\ndeficits through unilateral action like long giveaways that \\ncould cost taxpayers a trillion dollars.\\n    Congress needs then, it's very obvious, a fiscal reality \\ncheck. And I know our Chairman is trying to bring that fiscal \\nreality check by bringing up all of the issues that climate \\nchange is going to add to the budget and that's the correct \\nthing to do. But this reality check has to start with this \\nCommittee getting back to performing core functions.\\n    This includes holding hearings on federal fiscal matters, \\nexamining programs and authorizations that have been on \\nautopilot for decades and performing robust oversight of agency \\nspending. No government entity should be exempt.\\n    Now finally, I welcome the opportunity to work with you, \\nSenator Whitehouse, on budget process reform. You are a well-\\nestablished leader on this issue. I appreciate your stated \\ninterest in working with the rest of us on this issue starting, \\nand I'll be ready to join you anytime, from where we left off \\nwith Senator Enzi in 2019. It was bipartisan process then and I \\nthink we can build to get it over the finish line with this \\nCongress.\\n    Needless to say, we have our work cut out for us to get our \\nfiscal house in order. To paraphrase former fed chairman Paul \\nVolcker, cutting spending may be painful, but the pain for all \\nof us will be much greater if it isn't accomplished. So, I look \\nforward to our work over the next two years.\\n    Thank you and let's get to work.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Grassley, so do I. \\nAnd I mentioned the budget process reform in my opening remarks \\nfor a reason. I look forward to working on that and think \\nthere's plenty of blame to go around for where we are in terms \\nof the deficit, but having a Budget Committee that actually \\nlooks at the elements of that in an arthritically correct way \\nis a very, very good start.\\n    I am pleased to have three very distinguished witnesses \\nhere to testify before us today. Joining us remotely is Dr. \\nMark Carney, the former Governor of the Bank of Canada and the \\nBank of England. For those not familiar with that role, that's \\neffectively the CEO. Dr. Carney is a world renown central \\nbanker and has long been sounding the alarm about the economic \\nrisks posed by climate change.\\n    Following Dr. Carey's testimony we'll hear from Dr. Bob \\nLitterman, who chaired the Commodity Futures Trading \\nCommission's Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee, which in \\n2020 issued an authoritative report on this subject.\\n    Following Dr. Litterman, we will hear from Dr. Douglas \\nHoltz-Eakin, former Director of the Congressional Budget Office \\nand President of the American Action Forum. I note that back in \\n2003 CBO prepared a report on the economics of climate change \\nunder Dr. Holtz-Eakin's leadership.\\n    Dr. Carney, if we have you here remotely, please take five \\nminutes to deliver your remarks. Your prepared remarks are in \\nthe record of the proceeding.\",\n",
       " 'STATEMENT OF DR. MARK CARNEY, FORMER GOVERNOR, BANKS OF ENGLAND': \"AND CANADA \\\\3\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\3\\\\ Prepared statement of Dr. Carney appears in the appendix on \\npage 38.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Dr. Carney. Thank you very much, Chairman Whitehouse, \\nRanking Member Grassley, members of the Committee for the honor \\nof this invitation to address the risks and economic costs of \\nclimate change.\\n    During my terms as Governor of the Bank of England and as \\nChair of the Financial Stability Board, I headed committees \\nwith responsibility for understanding and addressing the \\nprincipal risk to financial stability. Risks such as the Chair \\nreferred to in his opening comments.\\n    About a decade ago, these bodies became increasing \\nconcerned about the rising economic risk from climate change \\nand the fact that the financial system lacked the information, \\nthe tools, and the markets to manage them. So, over the \\nfollowing years a wide range of regulatory authorities and \\nprivate financial institutions had worked to develop the \\nbuilding blocks of a financial system that can manage these \\nrisks on behalf of their depositors, pensioners, clients, and \\nshareholders.\\n    But while the pace of change has picked up, it's not yet \\nequal to the scale of the challenge. Due to the undiversifiable \\nnature of climate risks, governments will bear many of the \\ncosts of extreme weather and of adaptation. And moreover, the \\nlonger adjustment is delayed the greater the impact will be on \\nfinancial stability, inflation, jobs, and growth.\\n    Diversely, transitioning to a low-carbon economy will \\nreduce the impact of climate change, create jobs of the future, \\nand promote a resilient financial system. I won't read it into \\nthe record the fact that the fiscal impacts of climate change \\nare rising. I've reference in my testimony of the data \\ncollected by the EPA, the NRAA, NASA, amongst others, that \\nprovides a snapshot of how it's already impacting the United \\nStates.\\n    Climate change is having an increased impact on Americans. \\nAdjusted for inflation, the number of billion dollar disasters \\nhas risen sixfold from the first half of the 1980s to an \\naverage of 18 per year over the past five years. Annual \\ninflation adjusted cost of these disasters has risen seven \\ntimes from $18 billion to $120 billion.\\n    Increased flooding and coastal erosion are causing \\nsignificant damage already. Increases in weather-related \\ndisasters have lead to insurance becoming less available, more \\nexpensive for American families and businesses. Extreme weather \\nis reducing incomes for farmers and raising food costs for \\nfamilies and the increased frequency and intensity of flooding \\nand disasters disrupts and damages critical infrastructure, and \\nin turn, supply chains hurting American businesses and raising \\ncosts again for American families.\\n    There is ample scientific evidence that these trends are \\nexpected to worsen as each additional fraction of degree \\nwarming means more frequent and intense hurricanes, coastal \\nfloodings, heatwaves, and wildfires. Estimates suggest that \\nover the balance of this century climate change could reduce \\nthe level of global GDP per capita by between 10 to 20 percent \\nwithout further efforts to limit warming. Similar estimates \\nhave been found for the United States.\\n    As economically significant as these estimates are, it's \\ninstructive to examine what's not included in them, both assets \\noutside of the market economy, such as biodiversity and human \\nhealth, as well as critical economic channels, including \\ndisrupted supply chains, risk to monitoring and financial \\nstability, and economic impacts of rising risks to the national \\nsecurity.\\n    As temperatures increase and extreme weather events worsen, \\nthe cost to governments will increase further. Ultimately, \\ngovernments--state, local and federal--will better cost the \\nprivate households and businesses and markets are unable to \\nshoulder, including meeting emergency needs, financing disaster \\nrecovery, and building resilience to future extreme weather.\\n    To conclude, the costs to property, agriculture, and \\nlivelihoods are already high and expected to grow materially. \\nThe hit to GDP growth from unmitigated climate change is \\nexpected to be significant and many of the most severe impacts \\nto human health, to livelihoods, to natural heritage, are not \\nincluded in these calculations.\\n    But there's one final risk from climate change, a negative \\nrisk, better known as an opportunity. Increased recognition of \\nthe risks of climate change is no galvanizing efforts to \\naddress the issue. Last year over a trillion dollars was \\ninvested in the energy transition, representing over 1 percent \\nof global GDP and those investments are expected to rise \\nsignificantly, creating more jobs and higher incomes.\\n    In short, while ignoring climate change will lead to \\nsignificant costs, climate solutions are becoming one of the \\ngreatest commercial opportunities of our time. Thank you for \\nyour attention. I'll be pleased to answer your questions.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks, Dr. Carney. We turn now to Dr. \\nLitterman.\",\n",
       " 'STATEMENT OF DR. ROBERT LITTERMAN, FOUNDING PARTNER, KEPOS': \"CAPITAL, AND CHAIR, CLIMATE-RELATED MARKET RISK SUBCOMMITTEE, \\n         U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION \\\\4\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\4\\\\ Prepared statement of Dr. Litterman appears in the appendix on \\npage 46.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Dr. Litterman. Thank you, Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking \\nMember Grassley, and members of the Committee. Thank you for \\ninviting me to address the economic risks associated with \\nclimate change and the tremendous cost they may impose on \\nAmericans.\\n    This summer I visited Greenland to study the melting of the \\nice sheet. The icebergs calving from the glaciers are \\nbeautiful, but they represent the very beginning of what sadly, \\nwill be an inevitable acceleration of sea level rise, the \\ntiming of which, however, is both highly uncertain and depends \\ncritically on the actions that we take today.\\n    I want to focus your attention on time because time is a \\nscarce resource in managing risks. Climate change is a long-\\nterm global risk management failure, but it must be addressed \\nimmediately because we don't know how much time we have. The \\nUnited States has an urgent responsibility to do much more than \\nit has to date. Our grandchildren face grave danger.\\n    Global sea level rise in this century, for example, is \\nestimated to be between 2 and up to 10 feet, depending \\nprimarily on how quickly we reduce our emissions.\\n    Before I go any further, I'd like to tell you a little bit \\nabout my background as much of my work is highly relevant to \\ntoday's subject. I am an economist by training and have spent \\nmy career managing financial risks. I worked at Goldman Sachs \\nfor 23 years. I was a partner and head of the firm Wide Risk \\nDepartment.\\n    I now sit on several boards for groups that study and \\npropose responses to climate risks, including the Climate \\nLeadership Council and the Niskanen Center. No doubt, the \\nreason I am here today is because in 2020 I chaired the CFTC \\nClimate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee, which published a \\nunanimous and widely cited report, Managing Climate Risk in the \\nU.S. Financial System. We had environmental organizations, such \\nas the Nature Conservancy and the Environmental Defense Fund, \\nbut also Agri business companies like Cargill and Bunge. Oil \\nand gas companies like Conoco Phillips and BP, and banks like \\nMorgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Citi.\\n    There was no collection of wide-eyed environmental \\nactivists nor were politics involved. This was a rigorous \\nreport with dozens of recommendations from hard-headed experts \\nand we came to the unanimous conclusion that climate change \\nposes significant risks to the American economy that must be \\naddressed urgently.\\n    In the Agricultural sector, for example, we found that \\nclimate change is likely to significantly reduce crop yields, \\ndecrease labor productivity, degrade soil and water quality, \\nincrease the range and virulence of pests and disrupt supply \\nchains. Climate change will also impose large costs on \\ncompanies and governments.\\n    One example, the CFTC Report, highlighted with the case of \\nPacific Gas and Electric in California which entered bankruptcy \\nbecause of $30 billion in liabilities associated with its \\ninfrastructure, sparking record wildfires. Extreme weather \\nimpacts are already here and are growing rapidly, including \\nheatwaves, floods, hurricanes, drought, and wildfires.\\n    Meanwhile, the effects of climate change loom every larger \\nin the future. Losses from billion-dollar extreme weather \\nevents totaled $165 billion last year. And while it varies from \\nyear to year, the costs from climate change are clearly growing \\nrapidly. Extreme weather events are becoming more common as the \\natmosphere warms. Terms such as the 100-Year Flood are used to \\ndescribe the magnitude of an event that has happened \\nhistorically on average once every hundred years. That happens \\nto be an important frequency.\\n    We build infrastructure to withstand events that happen on \\na regular basis and so the damage created by weather that \\nhappens regularly is small. But when a 100-year event occurs, \\nthe magnitude is so large that we're not prepared and it \\ntypically leads to complete destruction of property. The \\nproblem is that while such a term continues to describe the \\nmagnitude of extreme weather events the frequency of occurrence \\ntoday tends to be much higher.\\n    Declining real estate values driven by climate-related \\nimpacts or the expectation of such impacts in the future could \\nsubstantially depress regional economic activity in exposed \\nareas. Climate change will also likely inflict large costs on \\nhuman health and its impacts will fall hardest on those with \\nfewer resources, increasing inequity.\\n    There are also a number of risks related to crossing a \\ntipping point. A tipping point is a nonlinearity in the \\nresponse of a system and there are a number of warning \\npotential tipping points in the climatic system. More worrying \\nstill, recent scientific research suggests that we may cross \\nseveral of these tipping points with even only at 1.5 degree of \\nwarming it may cross several additional ones with 2 degrees of \\nwarming.\\n    While the subject of this hearing is the economic risks and \\ncosts associated with climate change, I would be remiss if I \\ndid not mention one last thing. All of the research and \\nanalysis on this subject agrees that the sooner we act to \\nreduce emissions the lower will be the expected costs and risks \\nwe incur.\\n    In addition, a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy \\nwill, by removing policy uncertainty, likely actually result in \\nsubstantial investment and increased economic growth.\\n    I have lots of ideas on this subject, but the bottom line \\nis that with global average temperatures already having risen \\nover 1 degree C and with potentially catastrophic tipping \\npoints on the horizon, risk management demands an immediate \\nresponse leading to globally harmonized incentives to reduce \\nemissions.\\n    There are immediate steps that this Congress can take to \\nmove this process forward and I would welcome the opportunity \\nto discuss the policies you might pursue to help the risk to \\nthe economy and ensure that prices reflect the actual costs \\nassociated with production of goods, including the damages \\ncreated by carbon emissions. Thank you.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. We look forward to taking you up on \\nthat offer, Dr. Litterman and turn to Dr. Holtz-Eakin.\",\n",
       " 'STATEMENT OF DR. DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN': \"ACTION FORUM \\\\5\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    \\\\5\\\\ Prepared statement of Dr. Holtz-Eakin appears in the appendix \\non page 51.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eaken. Chairman Whitehouse, Ranking Member \\nGrassley, and members of the Committee, thank you for the \\nprivilege of being here today. Let me make three points quickly \\nand then I look forward to the chance to answer your questions.\\n    The first point is that climate change will have real \\nimpacts on the U.S. economy and these will worsen the federal \\nbudget outlook. Unquestionably, there will be additional \\noutlays from the national flood insurance programs and other \\ndisaster crop risks kinds of programs and mandatory outlays. \\nThe Congress will probably chose to make some discretionary \\noutlays in the future in response to the needs for mitigation \\nand/or adaptation and these will worsen the budget picture, but \\nthe biggest impact is going to be lower revenue from an economy \\nthat grows more slowly over the long term and that the loss of \\nsome capital assets, diminished labor productivity, diminished \\nproductivity in agricultural lands will cumulatively reduce \\ninflows to the federal budget.\\n    The Congressional Budget Office recently took a look at \\nthis issue and concluded that the center point of set of \\nestimates for the impact would be about a percentage point \\nlower in GDP by 2051. And I would just point out that while \\nthat's a significant impact it's tantamount to under a tenth of \\na percentage point slower growth each and every year.\\n    In contrast, and this point number two, the federal budget \\npresents an immediate and much larger economic threat. We \\nalready have debt to GEP in the range of 100 percent and \\nthere's a large literature that stems from the work of Ken \\nRogoff and Carmen Reinhart indicates that countries in that \\nrange experience slower growth on the order of a percentage \\npoint per year because of their debt burdens. And the U.S. not \\nonly has entered that range it has a budget outlook which is \\nunsustainable.\\n    The CBO will put out a revised Economic and Budget Outlook \\nthis afternoon at 2 o'clock. It will doubtlessly look like the \\none they put out last year that shows spending expending \\nrevenues as far as the eye can see, driven by very rapid growth \\nin the outlays in Medicare at 7 percent a year, Social Security \\nat 6 percent a year, faster than any revenue source could \\npossibly grow and as a result it will show debt relative to GDP \\nrising as far as the eye can see. The interest costs of \\ncarrying that debt rising as far as can see and that is a \\nmechanism which is a guarantee for slower growth in the future.\\n    The point of the borrowing is not just the debt. The point \\nis that that brings resources from the private sector into the \\ngovernment sector. And for every dollar you take from private \\ninvestment and put into the best of federal infrastructure \\ninvestments, you lose about 50 percent of the rate of return, \\nso you're losing on every one of those borrowing activities, \\ndiminishing the productivity in the economy, lowering the \\nstandard of living for future workers in the next generations.\\n    We really don't spend a lot of money on investments in this \\nprogram and more than likely we're going to take that money \\nfrom a private investment and put it into a consumption \\nexpenditure. That's the point of Social Security and Medicare \\nis to raise the standard of living in retirement for seniors. \\nThere's no rate of return to consumption investment, so the \\nfederal budget is the biggest headwind to economic growth \\nbecause it is stacked against investing in the future and needs \\nto be brought into some sort sustainable alignment in order to \\nstop these headwinds to growth.\\n    The other point that's going on in the federal budget is \\nthat the mandatory expenditures are crowding out discretionary \\nspending. Discretionary spending is where we do national \\nsecurity, basic research, infrastructure, education, all the \\nplaces where you can invest in the future of the country and \\nthose opportunities are getting squeezed out by the growth of \\nthese mandatory programs.\\n    So, point number three, not only would getting the budget \\non a sustainable trajectory improve the economic outlook, it \\nwould free up the budget resources through investments, \\nespecially investments in the climate mitigation and adaptation \\nthat are so important to this Committee and to this hearing.\\n    And so, I can't think of a single bigger accomplishment \\nthan for this Committee and the U.S. Congress to finally come \\nto grips with the federal budget outlook and its \\nunsustainability. It lies at the crossroads of all the threats \\nto our future and needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.\\n    I thank you for the chance to be here today. I look forward \\nto your questions.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I'll lead \\nand then Senator Romney is next in line.\\n    Dr. Carney, you've held two of the most significant and \\npowerful positions global in the banking sector. Climate change \\nwas not customarily a part of the banking sector's interest. \\nWhy is it that you took such an interest I addressing climate \\nchange?\\n    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Chair. It goes back, in part, to \\nyour opening comments, some of the points you made in your \\nopening comments, which is that under-investing in resilience \\nupfront leads to much greater costs down the road. And it was \\nparticular when I became Governor at the Bank of England and \\nit's not commonly known, but one of the responsibilities of the \\nBank of England is to oversee the insurance industry and it's \\nthe fourth largest insurance industry in the world. It includes \\none of the largest, if not the largest, re-insurance market, \\nthe famous Lords of London, and so therefore that's a property \\nin casualty and re-insurance industry that's directly affected \\nby climate change.\\n    And one of the lessons that the brokers and the risk \\nmanagers in Lord of London had determined was that the tail \\nrisk of the past were becoming the central scenario of the \\nfuture. I'll refer to Dr. Litterman's comments about one in a \\nhundred risk events becoming that much more frequent. So, of \\ncourse they're adjusting pricing. They're adjusting coverage \\nwhich as real implications for economies and it's apparent to \\nus, as risk managers, that this will affect the economy more \\nbroadly and the financial system potentially more broadly if \\nthere is not adequate information to assess the potential \\ndegree of those risks. And if risk managers don't at least have \\nthe opportunity to determine whether or not they will take \\nsteps----\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Carney, you were in charge of the \\nBank of Canada after the 2008 financial crisis. Can you compare \\nwhat you foresee with respect to climate with what you \\nexperienced in the 2008 mortgage crisis?\\n    Dr. Carney. Well, there's two things that I would say. The \\nfirst is that one of the experiences of that crisis, and many \\nof the members, of course, lived through it and helped managed \\nthrough it, is what's called a Minsky moment, a realization \\nthat basic assumptions were no longer true. For example, that \\nhealth prices would never fall in the United States, that \\ncapital was money good, that assets off balance sheets would \\nstay off balance sheets, all of those proved false and lead to \\nthe collapse or virtual collapse of the core, much of the core \\nof the financial system with huge economic costs that \\nultimately have added to the debt burden of the United States, \\namongst other countries.\\n    Now, in Canada, we were more fortunate for a variety of \\nreasons, but one of the reasons was we had put more resilience \\ninto our financial institutions upfront.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. I'm not getting into Canada \\nspecifically. I'm looking between what you project potentially \\nhappening with the climate crisis. What's the scale comparison, \\nin your mind, between what we experienced with the 2008 \\nfinancial crisis and what climate portends for our systems?\\n    Dr. Carney. Okay, so I'll just lead from that point. The \\nfirst point is what we want to avoid is a rapid and sudden \\nadjustment to the climate crisis, both adaptation, the impact \\nof fiscal damage or belated investments to address the issue. \\nThe orders of magnitude are potentially similar in those cases \\nif we delay adjustment.\\n    If we adjust upfront, actually, I'm of the view that we can \\nactually grow economies through the investments which would \\nimprove competitiveness. But if we delay it until it's evident, \\nand this is the tragedy of the horizon supremely evident to \\neverybody, then the orders of magnitude approaches the \\nfinancial crisis.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. And just to be clear, your testimony \\nis that climate change could reduce the level of global GDP per \\ncapita by 10 to 20 percent and in that calculation you leave \\nout critical economic channels that have not been modeled, \\nincluding disrupted supply chains, challenges to monetary and \\nfinancial stability that increasing climate change will \\npresent, and potential economic impact of rising risks to \\nnational security; is that a fair summary?\\n    Dr. Carney. That is a fair summary. And one of the lessons \\nof large shocks is they get amplified as they come through the \\nfinancial sector. Yes.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Dr. Litterman, the papers we have in \\nfront of us are littered with the ``systemic risk.'' It seems \\nlike a mild little term. Could you give us a sense of what its \\nimpact is?\\n    Dr. Litterman. The system risk that's incorporated in \\nclimate change comes from the uncertainty about how the economy \\nis going to be responding to the various different hazards that \\nare increasing. So, we have whole areas of the country that may \\nbe impacted by extreme weather, Florida, for instance, that \\ncould lead to significant financial stress in terms of the \\nability to raise funds for capital. So, you can have \\nsignificant systemic impacts on the economy. It's ones of those \\nthings we just don't know.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. You said cascade through the economy.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Excuse me?\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Systemic meaning it cascades through \\nthe economy and the sectors.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Exactly. It will affect every aspect of the \\neconomy, including government budgets.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. And last question, you said you were \\nhard-headed about your report. Explain?\\n    Dr. Litterman. Yes, this is a report that was created by a \\nbunch of scientists, academics, business people, investor, and \\nwe came to unanimous agreement. It wasn't about, I don't know, \\ngut feeling. It was about facts. And the problem is we don't \\nknow what the future is going to bring, so we have to be \\nprepared. It's very simple.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Good word to end on. I think my clock \\nstarted a little bit late, so if the Ranking Member would like \\nto go a little bit beyond that would be--all's fair. And I turn \\nto Senator Grassley, Senator Padilla next, Senator Romney next, \\nunless Senator Marshall returns.\\n    Senator Grassley. Dr. Holtz-Eakin, our rising deficits are \\ncast by a lot of people as long-term challenge, ``long-term \\nchallenge.'' Something we will have to deal with in the future, \\nbut not immediate problem today. Is that really the case or are \\nwe already living with the consequences of reckless spending \\nand borrowing?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, I certainly believe the impacts are \\nimmediate and shouldn't be put off. Most people characterize \\nthe threat as something that looks like, you know, a Greece, \\nPortugal sovereign meltdown that would happen somewhere in the \\nfuture if we just did nothing, but the reality is that the \\nmechanism I described in my opening remarks, the diminished \\nproductivity, the headwinds to raising the standard of living \\nare going on in small amounts every single year.\\n    It might be too tiny to notice in the moment, but \\ncumulatively there are an enormous impact on our progress and \\nso I think it's something that needs to be rectified \\nimmediately, both in and of itself, but also because it would \\nallow the Congress more flexibility in pursuing other policy \\nobjectives.\\n    Senator Grassley. Also to you, in last week's State of the \\nUnion address, the President once again tried to portray \\nhimself as deficit reducer. He pointed to last year's $1.4 \\ntrillion deficit, which was lower than the 2002 deficits due to \\ncessation by bipartisan pandemic relief. So, to you how would \\nyou rate the President's budgetary performance so far?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I think the Administration has done \\nnothing to improve the budgetary outlook. Certainly, if you \\nlook back at 2021, the American Rescue Plan was an enormous \\npolicy error. Something I said at the time, so it's not 20/20 \\nhindsight. It was a two trillion dollar stimulus in an economy \\nthat was growing at 6 percent. I was too big, was unnecessary, \\nwas poorly designed, lead to a lot of inflation, and this has \\nbeen followed by several proposals called Build Back Better, \\nbut did not add up in any meaningful way and would have added \\nto the core structural deficit in the United States.\\n    He's taken administrative actions for hundreds of billions \\nof dollars in student loan relief that are difficult for me to \\ndefend, so I don't see any activities being taken by the \\nAdministration that are recognizing the problems that federal \\nbudget faces and we need some leadership on that front.\\n    Senator Grassley. Dr. Carney, in last week's State of the \\nUnion address, President Biden admitted that the U.S. will need \\noil and gas ``for a while.'' Your firm, Brookfield Asset \\nManagement, has invested in oil and gas infrastructure around \\nthe world. Do you believe that the U.S. Government should \\nmandate private institutions divest from their fossil fuel \\ninterests, and if so, what immediate impact would this have on \\nthe average American?\\n    Dr. Carney. The first thing, I agree with the President and \\nthe timeline in continued need for fossil fuel. Secondly, I'll \\njust note Brookfield is one of the largest investors in \\nrenewables and operators of renewables in the world. Thirdly, \\nno, I don't believe and I've never advocated mandatory \\ndivestment of fossil fuels assets. In fact, to address the \\nclimate challenge what is necessary to get capital financing to \\nwhere the emissions are and ensure that businesses can invest \\nto get those emissions down and that's been a consistent \\nposition I've had for more than a decade.\\n    Senator Grassley. Yes. I don't have a question, but you \\nsaid--even though I have 1 and 12 seconds left, I'd like to \\njust make a statement, but it's kind of a question for \\ninformation from Dr. Litterman and Dr. Carney and it deals with \\nthe ESG movements within finance, within banking. And I know \\nyou don't have to invest where you don't want to invest, but as \\na family farmer in Iowa and my son, Robin, runs the family \\nfarm, but we're corn/soybean farmers.\\n    So, let's just assume that the FDIC or some other regulator \\nor bank say to the community bank in Parkersburg, Iowa that \\nyou've got to make sure that you know what the carbon footprint \\nis of the farmer and in 60 years of arming I don't know where \\nto start to answer that question. And then I think--so what is \\nobligation that banker is under an obligation to get that \\ninformation from me, but if the farmer can't give the \\ninformation how does it get out? So this is what I'm thinking \\nas a historic farming. When I started farming in 1960, we'd \\nmake 10 trips across the field and produce maybe 60 bushel of \\ncorn to the acre.\\n    Today with minimum tillage or no tillage, we make about \\nthree or four trips across and we produce--in Iowa, I think the \\naverage farmer produced 204 bushels of corn to acre. So, you \\ncan see that farmers are already producing unit of food with a \\nlot less units of energy than they used to and do we get any \\ncredit for that? I mean we've already been helping the global \\nwarming issue with more efficient farming and all that. But \\nthat banker in Parkersburg can say to Chuck Grassley you tell \\nus what your carbon footprint is.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Senator, it's not an issue of reporting what \\nyour carbon footprint is. We don't have to be aware of what the \\ncarbon flux out of the atmosphere into the ground is and \\nthere's tremendous opportunity for farmers to actually address \\nthis problem, to sequester carbon into their soil so they can \\nchange the way they farm. But we do have to address the \\nproblem. We have to measure the carbon. We have to understand \\nthe science. There's a tremendous opportunity in farming, in \\nranching, and in timberlands to address this problem and I hope \\nwe do.\\n    Senator Grassley. Well, what'd you think we been doing? We \\nhave been using midland tillage for 25 years, no till for \\nprobably about that long.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Well, sadly, the farmers have not been \\ncompensated for the things that they have done to sequester \\ncarbon into the soil. They are compensated for being more \\nefficient, but we haven't recognized carbon. Carbon movement \\ninto and out of the atmosphere is something that we need to be \\naware of. We need to measure it and we need to create \\nincentives. We all understand this. We need to creative \\nincentives to reduce emissions. Let's just do it.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. The Growing Climate Solutions Act is \\nan example to help farmers do that, which passed with big \\nbipartisan numbers. Senator Padilla, and then I had the order \\nwrong. Next is Senator Marshall.\",\n",
       " 'STATEMENT OF SENATOR PADILLA': \"Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Communities of \\nColor, Indigenous Communities, Low-Income Communities, and \\nImmigrant Communities are more likely to be located in climate-\\nrisk prone areas and areas with degraded infrastructure, making \\nthem even more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\\n    It was one of the many reasons I was proud to support the \\nInflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law \\nlast Congress which are making critical investments to combat \\nthe climate crisis. And notably, these laws direct resources \\ntowards many of the underserved and frontline communities that \\nI just referenced, which far too often bear the brunt of the \\ncrisis and other natural disasters.\\n    First question is for Dr. Carney. Can you talk about how \\nthe climate crisis disproportionately impacts these already \\nmarginalized communities and the importance of equity in our \\nfinancial response and investments?\\n    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Senator, for the question. Yes, it \\nis an unfortunate reality that climate change has these \\nimpacts, in part, through--well, through the direct areas in \\nwhich many disadvantaged communities live, proximity, for \\nexample, to our coasts and of course this Committee will know \\nthat 40 percent of Americans are living within \\\\1/8\\\\ of a mile \\nof coasts and coasts which potentially are subject to, on some \\nestimates, half a trillion of property damage over the balance \\nof this century.\\n    Secondly, to the extent to which more extreme weather \\nconditions leads to great volatility in food prices, energy \\ncosts, that will also be a direct impact to these disadvantaged \\ngroups. And then, thirdly, one of the issues that we all are \\ngoing to be facing around the world, but certainly in America \\nas well, businesses and families feasibility to get insurance \\ncoverage. As these impacts become more prominent, the ability \\nto afford it, if it is available, and of course, so for \\nfamilies, and I'll finish with this, that are already \\nvulnerable to not have the protection the insurance industry \\ncan provide because of just the risk, the greater risks that \\nhave become central scenarios, if you will, that adds to the \\nvulnerability.\\n    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Dr. Carney. Appreciate you \\nraising the issue of insurance coverage. We're working with the \\nWhite House on an initiative in that regard, so I look forward \\nto following up with you. But on the same broad theme, for far \\ntoo long it's the disadvantaged communities that I'm talking \\nabout that have also been underserved or face barriers when it \\ncomes to accessing financial services.\\n    Unfortunately, as Dr. Litterman wrote in his testimony, \\ncertain sectors of our economy are more susceptible to the sub-\\nsystemic risks of climate change. This includes community and \\nregional financial institutions, given they typically serve \\ngeographically concentrated areas and can suffer potentially \\nsignificant losses due to natural disasters and extreme weather \\nevents.\\n    So, given that these institutions serve a vital function in \\nproviding financial access to low-income individuals and \\nmarginalized communities, the risk is even more concerning. Dr. \\nLitterman, can you discuss the risk of these climate-fueled \\nsub-systemic shocks to local and regional economies and \\ndescribe how they could disproportionally impact these \\ncommunities?\\n    Dr. Litterman. Sure. Well, wealthy communities will be able \\nto build their infrastructure, harden their infrastructure and \\nbe prepared. I live in California and we see smoke more often \\nnow. Well, if I put a HEPA filter in and I can filter my air \\nI'm better off, but not everyone can afford that.\\n    People who can't afford to address some of these risks that \\nare coming, whether it's drought, smoke, heatwaves, and so on, \\nif they can't air condition their homes, they're going to be \\nsuffering. And we see that around the world when exposed people \\nare impacted by these hazards it's the poor that suffer the \\nmost. So, it's absolutely just one more example of where we \\nhave inequity and we're not paying attention to it.\\n    Senator Padilla. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Marshall, followed by Senator \\nVan Hollen, and then Senator Romney.\",\n",
       " 'STATEMENT OF SENATOR MARSHALL': \"Senator Marshall. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I'm \\nhonored to be here on the Budget Committee with you. I just \\nwant to commit to you and my friends across the aisle is that \\nI'm as committed as anybody is to leaving this world cleaner, \\nhealthier, and safer than we found it. That as a fifth-\\ngeneration farm kid that means that my family has been \\nstewarding the land for five generations. That the soil at our \\nfarm is in better shape today than it was five generations ago.\\n    But we've done things like no-till farming like Senator \\nGrassley mentioned since 1991. That we planted 20,000 trees. \\nThat we have fenced off creeks, we call them creeks in Rhode \\nIsland, Chairman, but whatever it is, creeks back home that \\nflow into wildlife refuges. We've created wetland habitat.\\n    Precision agriculture is exploding in Kansas, that we're \\ngrowing more with less, that we're reusing water, that we're \\ntaking the fat from the packing plants and turning into \\nrenewable diesel. My point is that American innovation is \\nworking and that's why the carbon footprint of American is 14 \\npercent less today than it was a decade ago.\\n    So, my first question is for Dr. Holtz-Eakin. And I want to \\nsay thank you for your Daily Dish newsletter, which I still \\nread daily and appreciate your thoughts on the economy. You \\nkind of mentioned this in your testimony. As we try to solve \\nthe problem here, which we all believe that the environment is \\na challenge for us right now, do you think that American \\ninnovation will have a bigger impact going forward or do you \\nthink that a federal government heavy hand approach will have \\nbetter results. And my question is, is the cure worse than the \\ndisease that the federal government keeps prescribing all these \\nexpensive propositions, is the cure worse than the disease?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Thank you for the questions and the \\ncompliments. I'm not sure that the latter is deserved, but \\nthank you.\\n    There's a real issue in having the climate strategy and the \\neconomic growth strategy work hand-in-hand. And one of the \\npoints I tried to make in my opening remarks is that at the \\nmoment the federal budget is an enormous headwind to economic \\ngrowth and if we have a climate strategy that exacerbates the \\nbudget problems it is going to make even worse the challenges \\non raising the standard of living for future generations. And \\nso, I worry a lot about that.\\n    I also worry about the fact that we are not guaranteed to \\nget anything out of something like the Inflation Reduction Act \\nbecause it has no sort of global coordination and this is \\nultimately a global problem. And so, when I think about \\nclimate, I come to the conclusion that the global challenge \\nwill not be solved without great U.S. leadership. I simply do \\nnot believe it is possible for the U.S. to be a laggard in this \\nregard and have there be any real progress.\\n    It will not be the case that we can make great progress and \\nthen provide that leadership if we are crippled by the budget \\noutlook that we have. And if we don't undertake a strategy that \\nfeatures innovation--and I have for a long time been an \\nadvocate of using carbon pricing, carbon taxes, in particular. \\nWell-designed carbon taxes are huge incentives for \\nefficiencies, innovation that are completely decentralized.\\n    On the ground people decide how they want to respond to \\nprice incentives. That's what made the U.S. economy the single \\ngreatest economy in the history of the world, using the same \\ntechniques to address this problem would be exactly the right \\nway to go. And so, I think the strategy that the Administration \\nhas adopted is not the best strategy. I think it will yield \\nlittle, quite frankly, in time and benefits.\\n    Senator Marshall. Thank you. My next question is for Dr. \\nCarney. Two questions, Dr. Carney, as you make your assessment \\nof climate, you talk a lot about carbon footprints. How do you \\nassess the cradle to grave impacts of what you're looking at? \\nHow do you calculate the cost of implementing your policies? \\nAnd I'm going to give you a ``for instance.''\\n    So, like Iowa, Kansas, over 50 percent of our electricity \\nis generated from wind. Unfortunately, wind energy is seven \\ntimes more per kilowatt to produce than from natural gas. Solar \\nis probably 70 times per kilowatt more than from natural gas. \\nAnd then when we transport that electricity, transporting \\nelectricity is 10 times more expensive than transporting \\nnatural gas. So, we're exporting a lot of that wind generator \\nelectricity and the cost of generating it and transporting is--\\nyou know, do the math, 70, 100 times more expensive.\\n    So, my question, going back to you, Dr. Carney, is how do \\nyou address the entire cradle to grave impact of your policies, \\nnot just the carbon footprint and how do you calculate the cost \\nof implementing your plans?\\n    Dr. Carney. Thank you. Chair just cut me off when I used up \\ntoo much time. Very quickly, I might refrain cradle to grave, \\nSenator, as well wheeled. So, the all-in cost of delivered \\nenergy. I would point out that the levelized cost of wind and \\nsolar, new wind and solar is now comparable, if not through, in \\nmany jurisdictions. It is less expensive than natural gas is \\nthe first point.\\n    The second point, and of course, subject to fewer price \\nfluctuations in local and world markets. And then a quick \\npoint, if I may, just to pick up on the fiscal point, I'll just \\nread into the record that one of the most effective mechanisms, \\nand the Chair referenced this at the start, is credible climate \\npolicy that would include regulation. And when you combine that \\nwith the financial sector and businesses having the right \\ninformation, you get the investment in technologies that are \\nefficient today, cost effective, and in the types of \\ninnovations that will be necessary tomorrow. And I'll just \\nrefer to a detailed analysis that Secretary Yellen and I did \\nprior to her----\\n    Senator Marshall. Well, we'll have to agree to disagree on \\nyour cost analysis of wind and solar power. I wish. I could \\nonly wish that they were efficient. Thank you so much. I yield \\nback.\\n    Dr. Carney. One of the largest investors in energy, so \\nthat's what we based it off.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Van Hollen.\",\n",
       " 'STATEMENT OF SENATOR VAN HOLLEN': \"Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank all of \\nyou for your testimony today.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin, I agree with your comments on carbon \\npricing. Many of us pushed for that for many years with \\nappropriate safeguards like border adjustments to protect U.S. \\ndomestic industry. This is not a puritan statement. It's a \\nstatement of fact. We weren't able to get any support here in \\nCongress from the other side of the aisle on that and that's \\nwhy I strongly support the approach that we took in the \\nInflation Reduction Act because we have to do something and I \\nthink if you look at it we will achieve significant reductions \\nin greenhouse gas emissions, not as much as I would like, and \\nthat brings me to a couple of points.\\n    Number one, first of all, I think there are huge economic \\nopportunities and job opportunities in going forward with the \\nclean energy transition. In my state of Maryland, we have two \\noffshore wind facilities that are being built, 10,000 good \\npaying jobs projected from those two facilities.\\n    We also know that the cost of doing nothing is huge and \\nthat's part of the purpose of this, today's hearing. And those \\ncosts are being borne as we speak in terms of taxpayer dollars \\nfor more climate resilience at the local level, at the state \\nlevel, at the federal level and the cost that insurers or \\nindividual citizens are paying through insurance and through \\nnon-insurance and just the impact on them and their property \\nand their lives.\\n    Mr. Litterman, you testified, and I'm quoting here that \\n``insurance markets are critical to diversify these risks and \\nto create appropriate incentives for individuals, companies, \\nand communities to prepare for extreme weather by building \\nharden infrastructure in buildings.'' You go onto say ``but the \\ninsurance markets are not working properly because historical \\nloss experience is no longer relevant for predicting future \\nlosses.''\\n    I noted that in Florida and Louisiana and California, at \\nleast one of those three states if not all of them you're \\nseeing just last year a number of insurance companies go \\ninsolvent because they just couldn't pay the bill for extreme \\nweather events. Can you expand on the comment you made about us \\nbeing unprepared when it comes to insurance to capture this \\nrisk.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Sure. Insurance companies base their pricing \\non historical experience. That historical experience is no \\nlonger relevant. We are in a new weather environment now and so \\nwe see these tail events happening much more frequently than \\nthey have historically. We have to base insurance on what's \\nactually going to happen or insurance companies are going to \\npull back. Look at California and wildfires. The probability of \\ngetting wildfires is now much higher than it was historically. \\nEveryone knows that, including insurance companies. And so, if \\nyou want to buy insurance, insurance companies they're going to \\nraise the premium, but the insurance regulators won't allow \\nthem to raise the premium because based on what they say. Show \\nme the data. Well, the data is changing every day. These things \\nare becoming more and more likely and so the insurance markets \\nare not working. Reinsurers understand this. They see the risks \\nand they say we won't underwrite these losses because we see \\nthem coming and so these markets are just not working.\\n    And then you get Florida, the federal government says we'll \\nprovide the flood insurance. California says taxpayers will \\nunderwrite the costs of fire insurance. This leads to incorrect \\nincentives. What people should be doing is recognizing that we \\nneed hardened infrastructure. We shouldn't be living in risky \\nplaces and we certainly don't want the federal government to be \\nsubsidizing people to live in areas where it's more expensive. \\nThat's just going to increase the total cost in the long run.\\n    So, we have to face the reality. I love what Professor \\nHoltz-Eakin said. We need to put a price on it. We need to \\ncreate incentives. People respond to incentives. That's all \\nthere is to it. And so, we get the right incentives, we'll get \\nthe right behaviors. If we have the wrong incentives, and the \\ninsurance industry right now we have the wrong incentives, and \\nso we get the wrong behavior.\\n    Senator Van Hollen. Can you speak a little more to the \\nsecondary market of insurers? Because as you said they get it, \\nright? Costs are going up as I look at these facts in Florida \\nafter six insurance companies went insolvent in 2022 alone, you \\nnow see premiums averaging more than $4,200 per year, almost \\nthree times the national average.\\n    So, as you say, at the end of the day, you're going to pick \\nup the tab, right? I mean you're gong to pick up the tab, \\neither the taxpayer or you're going to have to pick up the tab \\nthrough much higher home insurance rates and other insurance \\nrates, which is why obviously the best course of action is to \\ntry to address the issue at its root and reduce the impact to \\nclimate change. But obviously, we're in this already so we have \\nto provide the resilience.\\n    I can tell you in my state of Maryland, just over the last \\nfour years if you look at it, in the last few years we've seen \\na dramatic increase in extreme weather events, costing the \\nState of Maryland billions and billions of dollars. So, we're \\ngoing to pay one way or another if we don't figure out how to \\naddress this. And as I said, there's huge opportunities, \\neconomically and job-wise in addressing them. Thank you, Mr. \\nChairman.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you Senator Van Hollen. Do you \\ncare to respond?\\n    Dr. Litterman. I would just say that we can do better.\\n    There are models that we can run. We can get better \\nestimates of what the risks are, whether it's flooding or heat \\nor smoke and so on, and we should. So, basically what the \\ninsurance market is going to have to do is start relying on \\nclimate models to project into the future what these risks are.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Romney. Thank you for your \\npatience.\\n    Senator Romney. Pardon?\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you for your patience.\",\n",
       " 'STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROMNEY': \"Senator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no question \\nabout the impact of climate change. It's going to be \\nsignificant, devastating in some areas more than others. The \\nquestion is whether we're doing things that will actually make \\na difference and will lead to a different result.\\n    What I'm concerned about is that most of what we do here in \\nthe United States is--well, I'll call it virtual signaling. \\nThat term has been used recently. But we do a lot of things \\nthat make us feel good about ourselves, but will have almost \\nimpact on global emissions. If we want to do something serious \\nabout global emissions, we need to put a price on carbon.\\n    And our Democrat friends had the chance to do that during \\nreconciliation. They didn't. And so, we can talk about all \\nthese other things we're doing and getting more batteries for \\ncars and so forth, but the reason these things don't make a big \\ndifference is because the U.S. is not the big contributor to \\nemissions in the world. China is and Brazil and India and \\nIndonesia and all of the growth is going to come from them.\\n    China's emissions are greater than the U.S., the EU, and \\nJapan combined. So, when we do things here that are very \\nexpensive and disruptive to our economy, they don't change \\nwhat's happening globally. We have to do things that have \\nglobal impacts. So, research and technology and a price on \\ncarbon are the things that would make a difference.\\n    So, it's frustrating to talk about this as a huge challenge \\nto our budget and to our economy when it's out of control, \\nunless we deal with them the way I've just described. And yet, \\nthere is something that is in our control that both parties are \\nsaying we won't touch that. And what is in our control is the \\nlevel of debt we have. I just heard Professor Holtz-Eakin just \\nindicate that the impact on the economy of the amount of debt \\nwe're adding up is 10 times the impact of climate change, 10 \\ntimes. And yet, we're not willing to look at our entitlement \\nprograms to see if we can balance them somehow.\\n    I'm not talking about cutting them or taxing them. I just \\nsaying let's at least come together and work on it. But the \\nparties are afraid to even come together and have a discussion \\nabout how could we balance these things. It strikes me as one \\nof the most outrageous things my generation has done to the \\ncoming generations is to say we're going to spend on this money \\non ourselves. We're not going to tax ourselves to compensate \\nfor all that we're giving to ourselves. We're going to take all \\nthis money and then we're going to pass onto you for all of \\nyour lives slower growth so a more challenged economy and \\nhigher interest payments. It's unbelievable. It's almost \\nimmoral.\\n    So, I look at this challenge, Professor Holtz-Eakin, am I \\nreading this right that the challenge of the debt and our \\nunwillingness to balance what we spend with what we tax that \\nthat unwillingness is having a huge impact on economic growth \\nover the future and on the lives of our grandchildren and \\ntheirs?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I think it's well said. I'd just amended \\nit in two ways. I would take out almost in front of immoral and \\nI would say that it's a disservice to the beneficiaries in \\nSocial Security and Medicare to pretend that somehow they can \\nsurvive in their current form. They cannot. Trust funds will \\nexhaust in under a decade, Social Security trust fund in a \\ndecade.\\n    It is an enormous irony that something like the Social \\nSecurity program, which was meant to eliminate income \\nuncertainty in retirement and in old age is now the greatest \\nsource of income uncertainty in retirement and old age because \\nwe have no idea what that program will look like as the years \\nroll forward.\\n    So, I personally I'm enormously disappointed at a public \\ndebate that suggest we can't touch Social Security and \\nMedicaid. They are the only things we should touch. They are \\nthe most important things to touch and I would encourage this \\nCommittee to put that on their list.\\n    Senator Romney. Thank you. Dr. Litterman, I described what \\nI thought were the major levers that would have an impact on \\nemissions and climate and that came from a model that was \\npresented by a professor at MIT. They built this huge model \\nthere that shows all the things you could do and the impact \\nthey have. What was shocking was almost everything we talk \\nabout or we are excited about has no real impact globally, \\nexcept a price on carbon and of course investments in new \\ntechnology and innovation.\\n    Some of that is on the table, but the price on carbon never \\nhave; am I wrong on that or is that a fair assessment?\\n    Dr. Litterman. No, you're absolutely right. In fact, I \\nwould go further because when we talk about the budget deficit, \\nas Professor Holtz-Eakin knows, a carbon tax is a great way to \\nraise revenues. Polluters pay and that reduces the deficit, so \\nof course that's the right way to do it.\\n    And another thing I would say is that you're absolutely \\nright about the global perspective. This is not a U.S. problem. \\nThis is a global problem and the U.S. has to join the global \\ncommunity in creating harmonized incentives to reduce emissions \\nglobally. And right now those incentives vary across the board. \\nThe U.S. is kind of in the middle with very little incentives, \\nbut you know what our strongest incentive to reduce emissions \\ncomes from a gasoline tax. If I drive an electric vehicle, I \\ndon't pay it, but that's not a strong incentive, okay?\\n    In Europe, the incentives to reduce emissions are over a \\nhundred dollars a ton. In many Middle East countries, Russia, \\nVenezuela, there are strong subsidies to increase pollution \\nbecause they have fixed prices on fossil fuels, which are below \\nthe market. So, we've got to move diplomatically, and I would \\nsay what we have to do in the U.S. is provide our State \\nDepartment with the tools that they can go and negotiate \\nglobally to get these harmonized incentives to reduce \\nemissions.\\n    Senator Romney. Thank you. Mr. Chairman.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thanks Senator Romney. Senator Kaine.\",\n",
       " 'STATEMENT OF SENATOR KAINE': \"Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thanks for \\nkicking off our 118th Congress meetings of the Budget Committee \\nwith this important topic and thank you to the witnesses.\\n    So, I represent Virginia and it's a coastal state. Our \\nshoreline stretches more than 5,000 miles if you include all \\nthe snaking waterways around the Chesapeake Bay and the \\nAtlantic. And it's home to assets like the world's largest Navy \\nbase, one of the largest cargo ports in the United States, \\ntourism destinations like Virginia Beach and historic \\nJamestown, as well as commercial and residential districts, the \\nsecond largest metropolitan area in Virginia is the Hampton \\nRoad area. It's about 1.7 million people.\\n    Hampton Roads is listed behind New Orleans as the most \\nvulnerable community in the country to sea level rise and this \\nis not the only part of Virginia that's affected by climate \\nchange. We see intense rainstorms and flooding in the \\nAppalachian region of Virginia that cause much more severe \\ndamage than they have in the past. Even though the annual \\nrainfall hasn't changed much, it tends to come in much more \\nviolent episodes than it has in the past because of climate \\nchange, so obviously very interested in this topic.\\n    One of the things that I've been troubled by, and I want to \\npick up a little bit, Senator Romney was talking about debt and \\nspending and wanting to spend the right way, not the wrong way. \\nOne of the things I've been troubled by 10 years here in the \\nSenate is it seems like we are willing to spend a lot of money \\non climate change, but only in this sense, we spend in response \\nto emergencies.\\n    So, we'll do a superstorm Sandy emergency relief package in \\nthe aftermath of some significant climate event and you can \\npretty much count on bipartisanship. We'll try to find ways to \\nhelp our communities out when they've been hurt or we'll \\nrewrite the Federal Flood Insurance Program to provide more and \\nmore financial support for those whose residences and \\nbusinesses are getting more severe flood damage than they have \\nin the past.\\n    So, we'll come to respond on the backend, but what has been \\nharder to do is find smart resilience funding or even, more \\nimportantly, smart prevention funding. I do think, as Senator \\nRomney said, we are on the prevention side, some of the \\nresearch investments either in the Chips and Research bill and \\nin the Infrastructure bill or maybe frontloading some of these \\nexpenses in the prevention side.\\n    But if either of you would just have thoughts about in \\nspending and investing how should we be balancing between \\nprevention, resilience, and response and is there a way we \\nshould adjust that dial to make it more likely effective?\\n    Dr. Litterman. Well, I think the most important thing we \\ncan do is create the incentive now to prevent this problem from \\ngetting bigger and bigger into the future, so that's what we \\nhave to do immediately. The costs themselves are primarily in \\nthe future and so, among other things, we have to be prepared.\\n    I think in terms of what we really need to do to address \\nthis problem, as one of the senators mentioned, we have to \\ncreate the innovation to create the new types of energy--the \\nenergy, the infrastructure, the housing, and so on that will be \\nresilient to the future that's coming. And in order to do that, \\nin order to generate the innovation and the capital and so on, \\nwhat we need is to create the expectation among investors that \\nthere will be incentives that will pay--you know, if you have a \\nlow carbon approach that it'll be more profitable.\\n    Senator Kaine. Can I just say what about innovation and \\nthen I did want to have the Professor respond as well. One the \\nthings I like as sort of a little virtuous competition in the \\ninnovation space. I know some of what we did in the IRA has \\nmade European nations kind of mad, like what you're trying to \\ndo things that will make it harder for industries. But then \\nthey've decided, well, maybe we'd better up or investments as \\nwell and that kind of virtuous competition it can lead to some \\ntough words between otherwise allied nations, but it may not be \\nbad in terms of the overall goal. Dr. Holtz-Eakin, I know you \\nwanted to say something.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Just briefly, I mean if you take the flood \\ninsurance program as an example, for long periods we didn't \\nupdate the web maps and delivery didn't update the flood maps, \\nso that's a terrible idea. You have to know the risks you face \\nand then once you have those risks they have to be priced \\neffectively. And that means in some cases premiums that are \\nmuch higher than have been historically. That becomes \\nuncomfortable. Let's be honest about that. But it provides \\nexactly the right innovation and other incentives.\\n    Don't build a house where it doesn't belong, right, then, \\nyou will not have to pay out of the flood program when it gets \\nhit. New businesses to places are more secure for the future. \\nAll of that is the best kind of signal to send and it comes \\nfrom really doing mundane structural things in a lot of federal \\nprograms, but we're not doing that.\\n    Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you very much, Senator Kaine. \\nSenator Graham, followed by Senator Kennedy and then Senator \\nBraun, unless we have Democrats that are mediating. Go ahead, \\nSenator Graham.\",\n",
       " 'STATEMENT OF SENATOR GRAHAM': \"Senator Graham. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. This is a hearing \\nworth having, for sure. So, we all sort of agree on the \\nproblem. Climate change is real. It's affecting quality life on \\nthe planet over time. We all agree with that. What to do about \\nit is problematic, but let's talk about pricing carbon. Your \\nprice on carbon what would that translate to, Doug, in terms of \\nincreasing gas prices?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I don't have a specific price for carbon \\nthat I would translate into gas prices, but the literature says \\nvery clearly that the right way to do this is to have----\\n    Senator Graham. No, I got it. I got it.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Let me finish. Let me finish. It's a \\nrevenue neutral carbon tax so that you use the revenues to get \\nrid of other taxes that people who make gasoline will have to \\npay. So, the net impact on the pump prices is not always from \\nthat. Again, something is going down, not just up.\\n    Senator Graham. So, revenue neutral gas tax. You take the \\nmoney you collect from gas taxes and you offset obligations in \\nother areas, right?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Revenue neutral carbon tax economy-wide so \\nthat you can use the revenues to diminish taxes on capital and \\nlabor. Those are corporate income taxes, income taxes, payroll \\ntaxes.\\n    Senator Graham. Now, I'm making $20 an hour in South \\nCarolina. How do I get my money back for an increase gas tax?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Payroll tax reduction.\\n    Senator Graham. Okay. And how does that affect Social \\nSecurity?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Sadly, in reality, it doesn't affect \\nSocial Security very much because it's already not going to \\nhave enough money, so you better figure that out.\\n    Senator Graham. Okay. What would you do?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, Senator, I really like Senator \\nWyden's plan that didn't get into the Build Back Better, but he \\nsuggested that we have a low carbon tax to begin with, exclude \\ngasoline, and then allow the incentive to rise quickly and so, \\nthere are various ways to address this. I would say that the \\ngasoline is very inelastic and so you really don't impact very \\nmuch the amount of pollution by putting on a gasoline tax. I \\nthink there's much better ways to address it.\\n    Senator Graham. How would it affect utility bills, this \\napproach?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. How would----\\n    Senator Graham. Yes. I mean somebody's got to pay. Carbon's \\ngenerated through transportation and production of energy \\nitself.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, Senator, I'm not an expert on \\nutility, but I believe that utilities around the country have \\nvery different carbon footprints. So, in an area where you have \\nclean electricity it wouldn't be much of an impact.\\n    Senator Graham. I'm generally supportive, but the problem \\nwith this is we talk in circles. I'm asking you if we go down \\nthis road how much will your utility bill go up, how much gas \\nprices will go up, we need to actually talk more honestly about \\nthat. How about something maybe we can agree on, that if we \\ndon't get China and India and other big emitters to do better \\nit doesn't really matter a whole lot what we do here; do you \\nagree with that, Doug?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I do agree with that.\\n    Senator Graham. Does everybody on the panel agree with \\nthat? Is one way to do that a border adjusted carbon fee?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Certainly, if we had a global regime with \\npeople already doing something, right, then we should have a \\nborder adjustment.\\n    Senator Graham. Mr. Litterman.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Absolutely. Absolutely. I think it's a great \\nway to go and I think it's something that both parties can \\nagree on, so let's move forward.\\n    Senator Graham. So, if you're looking to make big polluters \\nlike China and India to change their behavior, we do all the \\nthings here at home may drive up prices. When they send \\nproducts into the country, they're going to pay a pollution \\nfee, for lack of a better term. You agree with that?\\n    Dr. Litterman. Oh, yeah, absolutely. We need to measure the \\nincentives globally to reduce the emissions, we need to \\nharmonize them, and we need to get them to the appropriate \\nlevel, so let's work together to do that.\\n    Senator Graham. If we do electrification of the vehicle \\nfleet along the lines that car companies are talking about by \\n2035, 2040, how much demand in power production will that \\ncreate in America?\\n    Dr. Litterman. I don't know, Senator.\\n    Senator Graham. Do you know, Doug?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I don't know the number off the top of my \\nhead. I'd be happy to get it to you. But in my written \\ntestimony----\\n    Senator Graham. Like a lot.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. But in my written testimony.\\n    Senator Graham. It's like a lot.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. It's like a lot.\\n    Senator Graham. It's like a lot. Where does that ``a lot'' \\ncome from? Can you do it without natural gas?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I don't think so.\\n    Senator Graham. Can you do it without natural gas, Mr. \\nLitterman?\\n    Dr. Litterman. Oh, yeah, absolutely.\\n    Senator Graham. Okay.\\n    Dr. Litterman. What you need to do is you need to create \\nthe right incentives and let the market work.\\n    Senator Graham. Time out. How much increase in demand for \\npower or power will come from electrifying the vehicle fleet? \\nHow much, 100 percent, 50 percent, 10 percent, 200 percent? Do \\nyou have a clue?\\n    Dr. Litterman. How much of the electricity demand will be \\nincreased by electrifying----\\n    Senator Graham. To cars or plugging into something.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Yes, I don't know.\\n    Senator Graham. How can you say if you don't know there's \\nno need for gas? This is the problem. Thanks.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Who said there was no need for gas, Senator?\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Kennedy is up next, followed \\nby Senator Braun. And for the record, for people who came late, \\nwe actually have a third witness, who happens to not be visible \\nbecause he's with us electronically, but it's Mark Carney, who \\nwas the former Chief of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of \\nEngland.\",\n",

So, you're advocating we do these things, \\nbut you don't know the ultimate cost?\\n    Dr. Litterman. Yes, absolutely. I certainly don't know the \\nultimate cost and it's very uncertain. It depends on \\ninnovations. It depends on----\\n    Senator Kennedy. I understand. I'm just trying to lay a \\nfoundation here to understand your expert testimony. Dr. Holtz-\\nEakin, do you know how much it will cost to make the United \\nStates of America carbon neutral by 2050?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Depends how you do it. If we do all on the \\nfederal budget----\\n    Senator Kennedy. Public and private dollars.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Sorry?\\n    Senator Kennedy. Public and private dollars. It's \\nultimately private dollars anyway.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Yes, I agree.\\n    Senator Kennedy. So, how much?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. You're going to look at $50 trillion.\\n    Senator Kennedy. $50 trillion.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Yes.\\n    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Thank you. If we make the United \\nStates of America carbon neutral by 2050 by spending $50 \\ntrillion, what you're advocating I gather? No? Okay, then \\nstrike that last part. I'm wrong. You're not advocating. You're \\nadvocating something.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. If you're going to do something, do \\nsomething smart. That's what I advocated.\\n    Senator Kennedy. Okay. If we spend $50 trillion to make the \\nUnited States of America carbon neutral by 2050, how much will \\nthat lower world temperatures?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I can't speculate what China and India and \\nthe rest of the world has done.\\n    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Have you heard anybody from the \\nBiden Administration say how much it would lower world \\ntemperatures?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. No.\\n    Senator Kennedy. Does anybody know how much it would lower \\nworld temperatures? No?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. No one can know for sure.\\n    Senator Kennedy. Dr. Litterman.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Yes.\\n    Senator Kennedy. If we spend $50 trillion or however much \\nit takes to make the United States carbon neutral by 2050, how \\nmuch will it lower world temperatures?\\n    Dr. Litterman.

We can't build a wall around the United \\nStates and say----\\n    Senator Kennedy. What if we spend $50 trillion, Europe \\ncooperates, most western democracies cooperate, but India and \\nChina don't, how much will our $50 trillion lower world \\ntemperature?\\n    Dr. Litterman.

I understand that China has a federal carbon \\ntax.\\n    Senator Kennedy. Yes, but face with a policy, okay, where \\nChina does something that's not in its best interest, but it \\ndoes it because it's in the global best interest, do you think \\nPresident Xi would do that?\\n    Dr. Litterman. I think that President Xi understands that \\nwe have to work together to address this global problem. Yes, I \\ndo, and it will be in the best interest of China to work with \\nthe United States to address this problem.\\n    Senator Kennedy. So, you think the answer is yes?\\n    Dr. Litterman. I think the answer is it's in China's best \\ninterest to work with the rest of the world to address this \\nproblem, as it is in the United States best interest to work \\nwith the rest of the world to address this problem.\\n    Senator Kennedy. Do you believe----\\n    Dr. Litterman. We need harmonized incentives to reduce the \\nissue.\\n    Senator Kennedy. Do you believe in the Tooth Fairy?\\n    Dr. Litterman.

       " 'STATEMENT OF SENATOR BRAUN': \"Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've been four \\nyears on the Budget Committee each year and the last two years \\nprior to this we did 16 hearings and we didn't do one hearing \\non the mechanics of actually doing a budget. This is the Budget \\nCommittee and we haven't put one together fully budgeted and \\nappropriate on time in 25 years.\\n    I've got four kids that now run my business, three of my \\nfour kids, and I was on a school board 10 years, state \\nlegislator for three years. No other place works like that and \\nhas a business plan that works into the future. I also come to \\nthe Senate and believe, as Republicans and conservatives, that \\nif we don't weigh in on big issues of the day shame on us. Then \\nwe're going to be at the expense of whatever the other idea is.\\n    Started the Climate Caucus back six months after I got \\nhere. Got six other Republicans to join and we've been an \\nengaging caucus, a real caucus that's met over time. So, the \\nissues are there, but I think until we--unless we want to \\nchange the name of this Committee to the General Issues of \\nConcern Committee, we owe it to the American public that we're \\nnot going to base it upon doing no budgeting, no appropriating, \\ndoing it behind closed doors, and dropping 4100 page bills in \\nour lap that none of us can read through and then having the \\ngall to borrow the money from our kids and our grandkids. That \\nis shameful.\\n    We should be fleshing out the climate issues probably in \\nEPW. I've been the loudest senator on the Republic side that \\nsays we have a broken healthcare system. Fixed it in my own \\nbusiness 15 years ago, made it consumer driven, but skin in the \\ngame from my own employees to be real healthcare consumers, cut \\ncosts by 50 percent, have not had premium increases in 15 \\nyears. That sounds like it'd be unbelievable, but it's true. \\nWhen you do things that make sense and that are sustainable. \\nYou know I've got healthier employees for that now.\\n    So, healthcare, it's breaking the bank in terms of \\nmentioned earlier Medicare until you reform the healthcare \\nindustry and embrace competition, transparency, don't get \\nhospitals all the rules and regs they need to become an \\nunregulated utility like a monopoly in the sense of how they \\nwork, probably going to see costs going up.\\n    So, I'm not going to weigh in on the climate issue, other \\nthan we've doing it. The experts there, the leaders and \\ncaptains of industry I think are accepting it as an issue. It's \\ngoing to be solved in that area through technology, not here. \\nAnd it does beg the question when China's building a coal-fired \\nplant weekly how does that hold thing fit into the equation?\\n    So, I want to cite a few more statistics and then I'm going \\nto ask Mr. Carney, who is out there in the cyber world and Dr. \\nHoltz-Eakin, what you think about the trajectory we're on. The \\nonly budget out there that anybody's had the nerve to be I did \\nit last year, privilege motion. We should discharge a budget \\nresolution by April 1st. There'll be some of us that do that \\nagain, but just cutting to what we do do, which is no \\nbudgeting, no appropriating, and then whether you believe in \\nreforming things on a climate basis and healthcare. What about \\nthe idea that we're adding trillions to our national debt, 18 \\ntrillion when I got here, now 31 trillion. Start back in 2000 \\nwhen we put a couple wars on the credit card. That took us from \\n5 trillion in debt to 10 trillion.\\n    Next Administration said, well, we're not going to be \\noutdone, added another 6 trillion. I get here it's 18 trillion. \\nIt's been off the rails ever since. Let's start with Mr. \\nCarney. You come from the banking industry. I debated Bernie \\nSanders for 25 minutes on the Senate floor about the modern \\nmonetary theory. Can we keep borrowing and borrowing without \\nhaving the consequences of crowding out all the issues that are \\ngoing to come into play, is that a viable long-term business \\nplan? And I'd like Dr. Holtz-Eakin to weigh in as well.\\n    Dr. Carney. Thank you, Senator. I'll make a couple quick \\ncomments. The first is that crowding out is an issue. I think \\nProfessor Holtz-Eakin has made this point in this forum and \\nother fora. And secondly, it is a relevant issue for climate \\nchange because of the cost of adaptation, resilience, and \\ndelayed action is going to lead to much greater crowding out \\nand bigger economic impacts as well. So, the fiscal situation \\nyou described, and I won't' comment on obviously on U.S. \\nsituation, but this underscores the importance of revenue \\nneutral use of regulation and effective policies that other \\nsenators have been referencing.\\n    Last point I'll make before handing it over to the other \\nwitness is I would just refer, given the earlier discussion, to \\nthe carbon tax in Canada, which is revenue neutral, is returned \\nto Canadians and insures about 70 percent of Canadian \\nhouseholds. I'm going to net ahead.\\n    Senator Braun. What about the modern monetary theory, \\nclimate aside?\\n    Dr. Litterman. I don't want to----\\n    Senator Braun. I figured you may not weigh in on that. Go \\nahead.\\n    Dr. Litterman. No, that's a theory to which I do not \\nsubscribe.\\n    Senator Braun. Well, I can tell you it's a bad theory. \\nAnywhere else you borrow from future generations it does not \\nwork out. Dr. Holtz-Eakin.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Well, one, the federal budget is on an \\nunsustainable structure and its getting worse. Two, it is \\nimposing costs on the economy today and will increasingly \\nimpose those costs. The carving out is real. And three, there \\nis nothing about modern monetary theory that coincides with the \\nreal-world experience. It's just incorrect.\\n    Senator Braun. Yes. And thank you for that. And I think we \\nshould try to discharge a budget resolution by April 15th, if \\nnot, I will take one to the floor again because it's our \\nresponsibility to our kids and grandkids not to run this place \\nlike we currently run it.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Senator Lee.\",\n",
       " 'STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEE': \"Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to take a \\nbrief moment to say that I appreciate the opportunity to serve \\non the Budget Committee as a new member and especially to do so \\nat a time when the state of our federal budget is in such \\nprofound disrepair, perhaps more so than at any other time in \\nour nation's history.\\n    Fifteen years ago, our public debt measured as a percentage \\nof the American economy, was at just 35 percent. Today it \\nstands at 100 percent and according to fairly rosy projections \\nwithin the next few decades it'll get up to 200 percent. And \\nwhether it's decades or just a few years away, we will reach a \\npoint where our interest on the national debt becomes the \\nlargest line item we have, bigger than Social Security or \\nMedicare or Defense.\\n    This fiscally irresponsible path that our federal budget is \\non is something that increases significantly the odds of a debt \\ncrisis and the associated economic pain that will inevitably be \\nborne by the American public, if and when that crisis arrives \\nin its full force.\\n    Just last year the Congressional Budget Office noted that \\nthe very tangible consequences of our federal debt needed to be \\nkept in mind or the high and rising federal debt that CBO \\nprojects over the next three decades would have serious \\nconsequences for the economy and federal budgeting, including \\nthe crowding out of private investment, higher interest costs, \\nand increased risk of a fiscal crisis.\\n    So, let's not fool ourselves. And most importantly, let's \\nnot fool those we represent, the American people. Blooming \\ndeficits and surging debt have been driven by and will continue \\nto be driven by runaway profligate spending by the federal \\ngovernment, not because of any effects of climate change. That \\nis a different thing. That's not what has caused our ballooning \\ndebt and deficit.\\n    There has become an all to prevalent quality in American \\npolitical discourse and specifically among many in the United \\nStates Senate and on the left who seek to climate alarmism to \\njustify a widespread federal government takeover of our economy \\nand a radical, unrealistic and damaging transition of our \\nenergy sector with all of its abruptness and all of its \\ndisregarding of things that have worked and helped elevate \\npeople out of poverty. And yes, even helped, in many instances, \\nclean up the environment.\\n    Dating back to at least the 1970s, a group of left-wing \\nacademics and media allies began making apocalyptic claims \\nabout climate change, stipulating that climate-related \\napocalyptic events would wipe out hundreds of millions if not \\nbillions of the Earth's human inhabitants over the next few \\ndecades. What's more concerning than the kooky theories of Paul \\nEhrlich or Thomas Malthus that a growing number of Democratic \\nmembers of Congress, bureaucrats, and private sector business \\npeople are now making similarly outlandish and inflammatory \\nalarmist claims about a looming climate apocalypse or at least \\nthrow support behind green new deal style legislative proposals \\nand regulatory mandates.\\n    Not only is this supremely misguided and shortsighted, but \\nit's not remotely necessary. It certainly isn't desirable. The \\nreality is that U.S. energy-related carbon emissions have been \\nsteadily declining over the last 15 years without any green new \\ndeal styled takeover of the federal budget and the American \\neconomy. And the same time China's carbon emissions have nearly \\ndoubled over that same time period.\\n    Democrats in Congress and in the Biden Administration need \\nto work with Republicans to promote American energy \\nindependence rather than promoting less efficient forms of \\nenergy, especially at a time of significant energy inflation. \\nAnd it's been financially debilitating to low- and middle-\\nincome American households. And those energy costs translate \\nalso to higher food costs and higher costs for everything we \\nbuy and everything we do.\\n    These costs don't fall on the wealthy like they fall on the \\npoor and middle class. But brazen regulatory overreach \\ncurrently being carried out by unelected and unaccountable \\nbureaucrats must come to an end as those decisions of making \\nlaw are expressly reserved for Congress under Article I, \\nSections 1 and 7 of the U.S. Constitution.\\n    Lastly, it's my hope that this Committee will spend more of \\nits time and effort this Congress deliberating ways to reduce \\nour budget deficits so that we can stabilize our debt while \\nputting our budget on a pathway to balance. Thank you, Mr. \\nChairman.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Lee. To be clear, \\nthe reason we're having this hearing and the reason that we're \\ngoing to continue to have hearings on this subject is that $10 \\ntrillion of our federal debt can be ascribed to exogenous \\nshocks to our economy with which we had to cope. It wasn't \\ncheap, but we had to do it.\\n    The biggest exogenous shock on the horizon out there is \\nclimate upheaval. That's not just me. That's bankers, corporate \\nCEOs, scientists, economists, people who will look at this \\nproblem all around the world. And it matters because we have \\nthe chance to head it off now if we take appropriate steps, \\nmany of which, as we've heard in this hearing, have support on \\nboth sides of the aisle.\\n    I'll also add that I mentioned at the beginning of the \\nhearing the prospect of healthcare reforms that can lower \\ncosts. Accountable care organizations were a perfect example of \\nthat and I look forward to working with members on both sides \\nof the aisle and with CBO to drill into the cost bases for that \\nand try to figure out we can do to do more of what looks like \\nalready trillions of dollars in healthcare savings that are \\nprojected from these changes.\\n    But I'll close with a round of questioning. I didn't have \\nthe chance to ask Dr. Holtz-Eakin questions, so I'm going to \\nyield myself a second round. And let me ask you, Dr. Holtz-\\nEakin, in preparing your testimony today did you familiarize \\nyourself with the Bank of International Settlements so-called \\nGreen Swan Report, which warns of, and I quote, ``catastrophic \\nand irreversible impacts from climate so large that''--and \\nquoted them again--``it would make quantifying financial \\ndamages impossible?''\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. No, I did not read that report.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \\nreport put out in April of 2019 by dozens of central banks that \\nsays, ``Estimates of losses are large and range up to $20 \\ntrillion when looking at the economy more broadly.''\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I don't know that report.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \\nDeloitte Global Turning Point Report, which concluded that in \\n2070 alone global GDP could be 7.6 percent lower compared to a \\nbaseline that does not account for climate change.\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I read that report--scanned that report \\nwhen it first came out.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \\nreport from economists largely centralized in Cambridge, but \\nfrom around the world that said that the effect on the U.S. \\neconomy would be more than $3 trillion in losses and GDP could \\nshrink by more than 5 percent due to the collapse of stranded \\nassets?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. I scanned that one as well when it came \\nout.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Did you familiarize yourself with the \\nreport from Freddie Mac, the American mortgage giant that said, \\nand I'm quoting here, that the economic losses and social \\ndisruption related to coastal property losses ``are likely to \\nbe greater in total than those experienced in the housing \\ncrisis and the Great Recession.''\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. No.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. I gather you did familiarize yourself \\nwith the CSTC Report that Litterman wrote. Correct?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. When it was released. Yes.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. And when it was released, its opening \\nsentence was ``Climate change poses a major risk to the \\nstability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to \\nsustain the American economy,'' is that correct?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Yes.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. And the second paragraph after its \\nheader says, ``Risks include disorderly price adjustments in \\nvarious assets classes with possible spillovers into different \\nparts of the financial system as well as potential disruption \\nof the proper functioning of financial markets.'' Not a good \\noutcome, right?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Not desirable.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Not desirable indeed. And then it also \\nsaid, ``A central finding of this report is that climate change \\ncould pose systemic risks to the U.S. financial system across \\nmultiple sectors, geographies, and assets in the United States, \\nsometimes simultaneously, and within a relatively short \\ntimeframe.'' Do you recall it saying that?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Not specifically, but I believe that.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. And you wrote a little report on it in \\nSeptember of 2020 which noted that climate induced risks will \\ncause dramatic financial fluctuations and the stability of the \\nsystem will be at risk. And then on the backside of your one-\\npager, you said that the potential risks to financial markets \\nposed by climate change represent a pervasive policy challenge. \\nHave I quoted you correctly?\\n    Dr. Holtz-Eakin. Yes.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Thank you. Closing words to Dr. \\nLitterman.\\n    Dr. Litterman. Yes. I would just say I am surprised, \\npleasantly surprised by the amount of agreement by certainly \\nthe witnesses here and the senators as well, and so I hope we \\ncan move forward. That's all.\\n    Chairman Whitehouse. Yes. I hope so too when I think that \\nthere are things that we can do. I think the key points coming \\nout of this are that we've got to move forward globally. We \\ncan't pretend that we can build a fence around the United \\nStates, soft climate here and not be affected by what's going \\non in China and India and other places, Russia.\\n    That we do have the tools to effect the behavior of China \\nand India and other countries through carbon border tariffs, \\nthat they're already underway in the European Union. And that \\nif we can pull together and be sensible about this we can take \\nadvantage of--I forget whether it was you, Dr. Litterman or Dr. \\nCarney, who said negative risks, opportunities. That there is a \\nhuge upside to getting this right.\\n    I'll close with the Deloitte number, which was that if we \\ndon't get this right it's $180 trillion in costs to the global \\neconomy. If we do get it right, it's $40 trillion in added \\nvalue. The upside, the negative risks, the opportunities. Let's \\ngo for that.\\n    I want to thank the witnesses for appearing in the \\nCommittee today. Their full statements will be included in the \\nrecord of our proceedings. As information for all senators, \\nquestions for the record, are due by noon tomorrow with signed \\nhard copies delivered to the Committee Clerk in Dirksen 624. \\nEmailed copies are also fine. We will ask the witnesses to \\nrespond to those questions within seven days of receipt of \\nthem.\\n    And with no further business before the Committee, the \\nhearing is adjourned.\\n    [Whereupon, at 11:43 a.m., Wednesday, February 15, 2023, \\nthe hearing was adjourned.]\\n[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n                                     [all]\\n</pre></body></html>\"}"

It is essential that governmental agencies \\nare responsive to the needs of the citizens that support them.\\n    The role of the EPA ombudsman was created in 1984 in the Hazardous \\nWaste and Solid Waste Amendments. This position was established to \\ncreate a place where people could issue complaints and request \\ninformation on the various programs that EPA operates. Even more so, \\nwhile the ombudsman was not supposed to be a policy or decision-maker, \\nthe position did allow the ombudsman to make suggestions directly to \\nthe EPA Administrator. The job of Ombudsman was, statutorily, intended \\nto end in November of 1988.\\n    Over the last 12 years, Congress has continually funded this \\noffice. As I have had a long-standing interest in the operations of the \\nEPA, I am intensely curious in knowing whether the Ombudsman's response \\nto the public and its role as liaison and citizen advocate is \\njustifying its continued existence. Particularly as the ombudsman's \\nplace in the Superfund debate in concerned, I want to know whether the \\npeople that have used the EPA ombudsman's office feel they have \\nreceived an appropriate response. I look forward to their testimony \\ntoday.\\n    Mr. Chairman, I believe today's hearing offers us a chance to \\nanswer a couple of important questions about the role of ombudsmen in \\nour governmental system. First, while the position of ombudsman was \\nfirst created over two hundred years ago, why did the United States \\nwait until ten years ago to consider it an important position for our \\ngovernment? Second, the ombudsman is supposed to be a job which is \\nindependent of politics and the Executive Agency it is supposed to \\nserve, does this separation between politics, policy, and performance \\nstill exist. Third, as Superfund is probably one of the EPA programs \\nthat receives greater community attention than some of the others, how \\nhas the EPA ombudsman responded at specific Superfund sites? And last, \\nsince the EPA ombudsman has operated without a congressional \\nauthorization for many years, should this program be affirmed with a \\nreauthorization or cancelled entirely?\\n    I look forward to the testimony and comments of our two panels and \\nthank you, Mr. Chairman, for bring attention to this important issue.\\n                                 ______\",\n",

Even worse, as we have heard from scores of witnesses, one of \\nthe biggest problems with Superfund has to do with all the lawyers. For \\nyears the program has been inefficient because of the wasted time and \\nresources as a result of waves of litigation, lawyer fees, excessive \\nadministrative costs and outrageous overhead.\\n    Often the people that stand to suffer the most are citizens who \\nlive in communities across the country that are located near Superfund \\nsites. Today, I am pleased that we will hear from some of these \\nresidents concerning their experiences with the Superfund program, with \\nEPA, and with the Superfund Ombudsman.\\n    The Ombudsman was created by law to ensure that affected the \\ncitizens would have a ``lifeline'' within EPA. To be effective, \\nOmbudsman must be there to help at times when citizens have difficulty \\ngetting their voices heard within the maze of federal bureaucracy. And \\nthe Ombudsman must be able to help bring forward legitimate concerns \\nwhen the government creates bureaucratic obstacles that hinder adequate \\npublic participation and ultimately delay cleanups.\\n    I look forward to today's hearing to assess the effectiveness of \\nthe Superfund Ombudsman over the years, and identify areas in which \\nimprovements are needed.

I look forward to \\nhearing the testimony of Bret Bowers from Coeur d'Alene who \\nwill speak on this issue, and he also has a short film that \\nwould be most interesting to the committee if he is allowed to \\nshow it.\\n    If there was ever an example, Mr. Chairman, of the need for \\nan independent Ombudsman process to keep a check on the EPA, \\nthat example exists in northern Idaho. Now picture this: A \\nbeautiful, picturesque lake whose water measures above drinking \\nwater standards is the place where this out-of-control agency \\nis treating this area as if it is a toxic waste dump, and yet \\nwe just heard the testimony from my colleague from Denver about \\nthe refusal to clean up the Shattuck Superfund site or their \\ndrawing out the process.\\n    So on one end we have a beautiful lake that measures above \\ndrinking water standards that they want to make a toxic waste \\ndump, yet we had the Shattuck situation over here where they \\ndrug their heels.\\n    Obviously, I can spend several hours today going over with \\nyou the numerous abuses, whether it be livestock feeder areas \\nor whatever it might be, but the fines, the misrepresentations \\nthat the people of my district have experienced at the hands of \\nthe EPA--in fact, I have for years investigated the issue \\ninvolving the North Idaho Lake Coeur d'Alene Superfund area. \\nThe bottom line is that the Agency has created a tremendously \\ndrastic solution in search of a problem up there. It is a \\nbeautiful area to live, and they can't find the problem, and it \\nis leading to havoc and distress in the communities spread \\nthroughout the whole Coeur d'Alene basin.\\n    Mr. Chairman, I have worked for years to expose the \\nmisdirected policies by the Federal Government in that basin, \\nbut I strongly believe that only when the Ombudsman Bob Martin \\nand his chief investigator Hugh Kaufman entered into this \\nprocess at our request that we achieved a breakthrough on this \\nissue, and your direct intervention--yours and Chairman \\nBilirakis's--certainly helped to elevate this issue.\\n    The sole purpose of the Ombudsman from the very beginning \\nhas been to get to the truth of this matter, asserting that by \\nonly finding the truth can we make good public policy and not \\nharm the citizens that we are meant to serve. They have not \\nbeen afraid to ask the tough questions, as you will see in the \\nfilm, no matter what threats they are receiving from their own \\nagency or even from the U.S. Justice Department.\\n    Mr. Chairman, as you will hear about today, in August of \\nthis year, Mr. Martin and Mr. Kaufman conducted a 15-hour \\nhearing in Idaho on the Superfund issue, finally bringing to \\nthe surface many troubling questions that have plagued this \\narea. So, as a result, we are working together and we are \\nforcing EPA to answer some very important and critical \\nquestions.\\n    Mr. Chairman, I have more in my opening statement. I would \\nlike to submit it for the record.\\n    At this time, I will yield back the balance of my time. \\nThank you.\\n    Mr. Oxley.

I encourage the Committee to pay close \\nattention to his testimony. He is a vocal leader on this issue and \\nknows first hand the harms of EPA policy in the region, and the need \\nfor an ombudsman process.\\n    Mr. Chairman, if there was ever an example of the need for an \\nindependent ombudsman process to keep a check on the EPA, that example \\nexists in northern Idaho--where this out-of-control agency is treating \\none of the most beautiful river basins in the country as if it were a \\ntoxic waste dump.\\n    I could spend several hours today going over with you the numerous \\nabuses and misrepresentations that the people of northern Idaho have \\nexperienced at the hands of the EPA.

But I strongly believe \\nthat when the Ombudsman, Bob Martin, and his Chief Investigator, Hugh \\nKauffman, entered into the process at our request, we achieved a break \\nthrough on this issue. Their sole purpose has from the very beginning \\nhas been to get to the truth of this matter, asserting that by only \\nfinding the truth can we make good public policy and not harm the \\ncitizens we are meant to serve.

For instance, why did the EPA prepare a plan to take \\nover a private mine without even informing the owner of the mine? Or, \\nwhy has the agency not even considered the bioavailability of lead in \\ndetermining the health and environmental hazards of mixture of minerals \\nin the soil? Why has the agency not tested for the natural occurrence \\nof lead in this mineral rich area? Why does it continue to push for an \\nexpansion of the process when there are no discernible health and \\nenvironmental problems? What did the agency do with $80 million worth \\nof Indium?\\n    Mr. Chairman, shutting this process down before we have had a \\nchance to answer these and many other critical questions would be \\nnothing short of irresponsible, costly and even tragic. For the sake of \\nthe numerous impacted communities throughout this nation, this $7 \\nbillion dollar agency requires an independent investigatory wing--with \\nmuch more resources than a shoestring budge of $300,000 and a couple of \\npublic servants expected to cover several investigations at once. I \\nstrongly encourage the committee to support an independent ombudsman \\nprocess, and keep these numerous governmental abuses of the people at \\nbay. Again, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to be here today.\\n\\n    Mr. Oxley.

Gentlemen, welcome.\\n    Mr. Fields, we will begin with you.\\n\\n  STATEMENTS OF TIMOTHY FIELDS, JR., ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR, \\n      OFFICE OF SOLID WASTE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE, U.S. \\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY; AND ROBERT MARTIN, OMBUDSMAN, \\n              U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\\n\\n    Mr. Fields. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a pleasure to be \\nhere today before both of your subcommittees to talk about this \\nvery important topic, namely the functions of the OSWER \\nOmbudsman at EPA.\\n    I am pleased to be here with Mr. Robert J. Martin, the \\nNational Ombudsman for the EPA Office of Solid Waste and \\nEmergency Response; and I would like to start by just giving a \\nbrief summary of how this function has evolved over the years \\nsince Congress enacted it in legislation in 1984 as part of the \\namendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.\\n    That office was established to address public inquiries or \\ncomplaints regarding the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act \\nof that time. The statutory authority did expire about 5 years \\nlater and EPA, though, believed the function was very valuable \\nso we agreed to continue this function as a part of EPA's \\noperation, even though the congressional mandate had expired.\\n    In 1991, the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response \\nexpanded the functions of the Ombudsman to include not just the \\nRCRA hazardous waste and solid waste programs but also \\nSuperfund, underground storage tanks and other elements of our \\nnational environmental cleanup and waste management program.\\n    In 1995, the Administrator of the EPA, Carol Browner, \\nannounced an administrative reform to create 10 Regional \\nOmbudsmen in our 10 regions that would be there to respond \\nlocally to public inquiries or concerns as well.\\n    We fully support the National Ombudsman function in \\nheadquarters. That is why, when the statutory mandate for this \\nexpired more than 11 years ago, we agreed to continue it and \\nhave since that time.\\n    To address the evolution of the Ombudsman function, though, \\nwhich has expanded in authority based on our administrative \\npolicy to do so, we have tried to promote coordination between \\nthe National Ombudsman and the 10 Regional Ombudsmen that exist \\nin the 10 EPA regional offices..\\n    We are now developing new program guidance to supplement \\nand update the outdated Hazardous Waste Ombudsman Handbook \\nwhich we have been operating under since 1987. A work group was \\nconvened last year, including the National Ombudsman Bob \\nMartin, some of the Regional Ombudsmen, other headquarters and \\nregional officials of EPA, to develop an updated guidance \\ndocument. The guidance is undergoing internal EPA review at the \\ncurrent time, and we hope to publish this in the Federal \\nRegister in the next several weeks, making it available for \\npublic comment for 60 days. We then intend to finalize this new \\nupdated Ombudsman guidance in terms of how the EPA Ombudsman \\nboth in headquarters and our regions would operate. The Agency \\nplans to also publish this draft guidance on our EPA Web site \\nto make it more available to the public as well.\\n    Today, the National Ombudsman responds to numerous \\ninquiries and complaints about programs administered by our \\nwaste programs and environmental cleanup programs both in \\nheadquarters and the regions. For the most part, the National \\nOmbudsman obviously handles cases of national significance or \\ncases where there is an actual or perceived conflict of \\ninterest on the part of a Regional Ombudsman. The ombudsman's \\nrole is primarily to focus on the Agency's practices and \\nprocedures and how citizens or other interested parties have \\nbeen treated under those practices and procedures.\\n    The Ombudsman strives to encourage and promote changes to \\npolicy, practices and procedures that will both impact and \\naddress the concerns of individuals as well as the community as \\na whole. I think the Ombudsman has been very successful at \\ndoing that over the years.\\n    The Ombudsman has a wide latitude in terms of selecting and \\ninvestigating complaints. The Office of Solid Waste and \\nEmergency Response recognizes the importance of the Ombudsman \\nfunction, and we want to try to make it as independent to the \\nmaximum extent possible under our laws and regulations.\\n    EPA steadily over the years increased the funding for the \\nOmbudsman function, and we continue to provide support to not \\nonly the National Ombudsman but also additional support to the \\n10 Regional Ombudsmen as well, to the tune of about a million \\ndollars a year.\\n    I believe the Ombudsman program is operating very \\nsuccessfully. I recognize it can operate even better. I assure \\nyou that the Agency will continue to support the Ombudsman \\nfunction, irrespective of whether new legislation is enacted or \\nnot. We intend to continue to provide resources to make the \\nfunction capable of assisting communities across the country as \\nit has in the past.\\n    I look forward to responding to questions that the \\nsubcommittees may have on this. I think we share a common goal \\nwith the two subcommittees convened today and Mr. Martin, which \\nis to make the Ombudsman function as effective and efficient as \\nit can be so that we can meet the needs of citizens across this \\ncountry.\\n    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.\\n    [The prepared statement of Timothy Fields, Jr. follows:]\",\n",
       " 'Prepared statement of timothy fields': \"JR., ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE OF SOLID WASTE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \\n                                 AGENCY\\n\\n                              INTRODUCTION\\n\\n    Good morning, I am Timothy Fields, Jr., Assistant Administrator for \\nthe Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) at the \\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA). I am accompanied this morning by \\nMr. Robert J. Martin, the OSWER National Ombudsman. Mr. Martin and I \\nwant to thank the Committee for the opportunity to appear before you \\ntoday to discuss the national EPA Ombudsman program\\n\\n                 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE OMBUDSMAN\\n\\n    The hazardous and solid waste management laws passed by Congress \\ncreated some of the most complex programs administered by EPA and the \\nStates. Recognizing this, Congress established a National Ombudsman \\nfunction in 1984 as part of amendments to the Resource Conservation and \\nRecovery Act (RCRA). Establishing an Ombudsman provided the public with \\nsomeone to contact with questions and concerns about the RCRA program. \\nWhen the statutory authority for the National Ombudsman program expired \\nin 1989, EPA's OSWER retained the function as a matter of policy. In \\n1991, OSWER broadened the National Ombudsman's scope of activity to \\ninclude other programs administered by OSWER, particularly the \\nSuperfund program. The National Ombudsman is located in the EPA \\nHeadquarters office in Washington, D.C. and reports directly to the \\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and Emergency \\nResponse.\\n    The Ombudsman is authorized to provide information and investigate \\ncomplaints and grievances related to OSWER's administration of the \\nhazardous substance and hazardous and solid waste programs implemented \\nunder the following authorities:\\n\\n<bullet> Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and \\n        Liability Act (CERCLA) or Superfund;\\n<bullet> Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), including UST;\\n<bullet> Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) or \\n        Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, Title III;\\n<bullet> Oil Pollution Act; and\\n<bullet> Clean Air Act, Section 112(r).\\n    In 1995, a Regional Ombudsman position was created in each EPA \\nRegional office as part of the Agency's Superfund Administrative \\nReforms effort. On June 4, 1996, Administrator Browner formally \\nannounced the appointments of the Regional Ombudsmen. The Regional \\nOmbudsmen program, at a minimum, operates in support of the Superfund \\nprogram. Depending on the Region, however, the Regional Ombudsman may \\nalso provide support to other programs, including RCRA, Underground \\nStorage Tanks (UST), and chemical emergency prevention and \\npreparedness.\\n    We fully support the National Ombudsman program under the \\njurisdiction of the Assistant Administrator for OSWER. We believe that \\nthe Ombudsman function is a very important one for the Agency and the \\npublic. That is why when the statutory authorization for the Hazardous \\nWaste Ombudsman function expired, EPA chose administratively to \\nmaintain the Ombudsman function and broaden the scope of the function.\\n\\n                  PURPOSE AND STATUS OF DRAFT GUIDANCE\\n\\n    Soon after Congress established the Ombudsman program, the Agency \\nissued the Hazardous Waste Ombudsman Handbook to help the newly created \\nNational and Regional Ombudsmen administer, and the public understand \\nwhat to expect from, the Ombudsman program. During the initial years of \\nthe Ombudsman program, most of the assistance sought by the public was \\nfor help understanding the complicated RCRA program. The Ombudsmen \\nspent most of their time responding to general questions and directing \\nrequests to the appropriate sources. The handbook reflected this role.\\n    Over the years, the public gained a better understanding of EPA's \\nhazardous waste programs. Requests for answers to basic questions \\nbecame requests for resolution of complaints. The Ombudsman function \\nhas evolved to reflect the changing needs of its clients. The existing \\nguidance no longer reflects the evolution of the Ombudsman function. In \\nthe Fall of 1999, the Assistant Administrator of OSWER established an \\ninternal EPA workgroup to look at updating the Hazardous Waste \\nOmbudsman Handbook. The workgroup, chaired by Michael Shapiro, \\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Administrator for OSWER, includes several \\nRegional Ombudsmen, the National Ombudsman, representatives from the \\nOffice of General Counsel, the Office of Inspector General, the Office \\nof Enforcement and Compliance Assurance and several senior Regional \\nManagers. In preparing the updated guidance, the workgroup met with \\nrepresentatives of the U.S. Ombudsman Association and evaluated and \\nconsidered guidance documents from this organization as well as other \\norganizations with Ombudsman programs and the American Bar \\nAssociation's draft Standards for the Establishment and Operation of \\nOmbudsman Offices. The workgroup has attempted to draft guidance which \\nreflects key aspects of various external models in a manner that works \\nfor a civil service position within the Federal structure. We believe \\nthe draft guidance will provide for effective and fair implementation \\nof OSWER's Ombudsman program.\\n    The updated guidance will explain to the public the role of the \\nNational Hazardous Waste and Superfund Ombudsman and Regional Superfund \\nOmbudsmen today, their scope of activity, and the guidelines under \\nwhich they coordinate and carry out their responsibilities. The main \\nobjective in issuing this guidance is to improve the effectiveness of \\nthe program by giving the Ombudsmen, and those who may contact them, a \\nclear and consistent set of operating expectations and policies.\\n    The guidance is currently undergoing internal Agency review. The \\nAgency expects this review to be completed in the next several weeks. \\nEPA will then publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the \\navailability of the draft document and requesting public comment. I am \\nanticipating a public comment period of 60 days. The Agency also plans \\nto make the draft guidance available on EPA's internet website.\\n    I will now share with you the Agency experience with the operation \\nand role of the National and Regional Ombudsmen.\\n\\n                       THE ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN\\n\\n    The Ombudsman is the Agency official designated to receive \\ninquiries and complaints about the administration of an OSWER program. \\nIt is important to note, however, that the role of the Ombudsman is not \\nthat of decision-maker nor of a substantive expert for the Agency. The \\nOmbudsman's role is primarily to focus on the Agency's procedures and \\nhow citizens and other interested parties have been treated under those \\nprocedures.\\n    The Ombudsman is not an advocate for a community or any person or \\ninstitution. Rather, the Ombudsman encourages and promotes changes he/\\nshe believes will serve both the individual and the public interest. \\nThe Ombudsman seeks to reform and improve management practices, \\npolicies, or administration of such policies that he/she believes are \\ninefficient or unfair and that may have given or may give rise to a \\ncomplaint.\\n    Generally, the National Ombudsman handles cases of national \\nsignificance and/or cases of actual or perceived conflict of interest \\non the part of the Regional Ombudsman. The Regional Ombudsmen handle \\nthe more routine requests for assistance and conduct more informal \\ninquiries to investigate complaints. Nevertheless, the Ombudsmen may be \\ncalled upon to serve in a number of capacities: 1) providing \\ninformation and facilitating informal contact with EPA staff, 2) \\nconducting informal fact finding inquiries and developing options to \\ndeal with difficult problems, 3) helping to mediate disputes, and 4) \\nmaking recommendations to Agency senior management regarding procedural \\nand policy changes that will improve the program. The goal of the \\nOmbudsman is to respond to requests in an appropriate and objective \\nmanner as promptly, informally and privately as possible.\\n\\nProviding Information\\n    Many members of the public and regulated community either do not \\nknow how to get information about the solid and hazardous waste \\nprograms in OSWER or feel frustrated in their attempts to cope with the \\ncomplexities of these programs. The Ombudsman may be asked to help a \\ncitizen understand how EPA operates, what the appropriate laws, rules, \\nor policies are, or how a citizen may directly handle a complaint. The \\nOmbudsman may answer general questions about any of the programs \\nadministered by OSWER, or may direct the person to the appropriate EPA \\nstaff to answer the questions. The Ombudsman may also facilitate the \\ncommunication between a requester and EPA staff. In doing so, the \\nOmbudsman assists members of the public to gain access to information \\nabout the solid and hazardous waste program that will help them \\nparticipate more fully in established Agency processes.\\n\\nConducting Inquiries\\n    The Ombudsman may look into a requestor's concerns with respect to \\nany program or requirement under the solid and hazardous waste programs \\nimplemented by OSWER. The purpose of such an inquiry will be to \\nascertain the facts of the case and the perspectives of all the \\ninvolved parties. Since the Ombudsman has no direct decision-making \\nauthority, if he/she finds that a policy or procedure has not been \\nproperly followed or someone has not been treated fairly, he/she may \\nmake recommendations to the appropriate Agency officials. In such \\ncases, the Ombudsman will generally issue a report explaining the \\nfindings and supporting the recommendations made. The officials who \\nadminister activities being criticized will be given a chance to review \\nthe report prior to its release and attach comments to it.\\n\\nMediating Disputes\\n    Many of the issues brought to the attention of the Ombudsman may be \\nresolved through facilitated communication or informal mediation, with \\nthe Ombudsman serving in the capacity of a neutral third party. It is \\nalmost always in the best interests of those who ask the Ombudsman for \\nassistance and the Agency if a mutually agreeable solution can be \\nfound. If the circumstances seem favorable, the Ombudsman will work \\nwith the parties and help them move toward agreement. The role of the \\nOmbudsman is not to advocate for a particular outcome, but to try to \\nincrease understanding and to assist in the search for appropriate ways \\nto reach closure.\\n    Unlike formal mediation, the Ombudsman always retains the \\ndiscretion to limit the issues which will be considered (in formal \\nmediation the issues to be discussed are left to the parties to \\ndecide). Also, unlike formal mediation, the Ombudsman is as concerned \\nabout identifying and encouraging needed institutional reforms as in \\nsolving a specific problem.\\n\\nEncouraging Institutional Reform\\n    The Ombudsman is in a unique position to improve the management and \\nimplementation of the OSWER-related programs. On a regular basis, he/\\nshe hears issues, concerns and criticisms of the programs from a wide \\nvariety of sources. From this, he/she may identify policies and \\nprocedures which are causing problems as well as opportunities for \\nmaking program operations more efficient or effective. Alerting senior \\nEPA managers to what may be an unwise policy or practice, or unfair \\nadministration of a policy is as important as the resolution of the \\nspecific problem. By making well documented recommendations to EPA \\nprogram managers, the Ombudsman can point the way to positive \\ninstitutional change that should prevent or reduce future similar \\nproblems from arising in the future.\\n\\n                     INDEPENDENCE OF THE OMBUDSMEN\\n\\n    No matter what capacity an Ombudsman is serving in at any given \\ntime, the Agency has worked to ensure the Ombudsmen's ability to \\noperate independently. As you are probably aware, one of the main \\nprinciples an Ombudsman operates under is the ability to operate \\nindependently in determining what cases to work on, how an inquiry \\nshould proceed and what are the findings of a inquiry.\\n    From the time the National Ombudsman was established by Congress, \\nthis function has been a federal government employee reporting to a \\nsenior Agency official. Because the Ombudsman is a federal employee, \\nthe National Ombudsman cannot be completely independent in the normal \\ncourse of relations between supervisors and their employees. But, OSWER \\nrecognizes the importance of an Ombudsman being and appearing to be \\nindependent from the organization he/she is investigating. For example, \\nOSWER has given the National Ombudsman his independence to the maximum \\nextent possible. The Assistant Administrator (AA) for OSWER does not \\nmonitor the Ombudsman's workload. The AA does not select which cases \\nthe Ombudsman will take, nor directs the Ombudsman how to investigate a \\ncomplaint. The AA does not interfere with or attempt to influence the \\nOmbudsman as he formulates his findings and recommendations.\\n    The National Ombudsman reports to Deputy Assistant Administrator \\n(DAA) Michael Shapiro. As his supervisor, DAA Shapiro is the approving \\nofficial on all procurements requested by the National Ombudsman. \\nGenerally, for ongoing investigations, funding is approved on an as-\\nneeded basis. Where significant resources are requested, DAA Shapiro \\nmay become more involved in a case so he is able to determine that the \\nresources requested are available and that the procurement is the \\neffective mechanism to accomplish the Ombudsman's objective.\\n\\n                   FUNDING FOR THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM\\n\\n    The EPA has provided adequate resources (funding, person-years, \\netc.) for the Ombudsman function since it was created. In all cases \\nwhen the need has arisen, additional funds have been provided to the \\nOmbudsman function. That includes the assignment of staff to support \\nthis function and the assistance of the ten Regional Ombudsman as \\nneeded. In addition, the Ombudsman, depending on the site and issues \\nunder review, has accessed the technical expertise of the EPA's \\nEnvironmental Response Team to supplement his investigative efforts.\\n    Over the years, funding for the National Ombudsman function has \\nsteadily increased despite the fact the Superfund program budget has \\nbeen reduced. In fact, funding has gone from roughly $117 thousand in \\nfiscal year 1993 to over $519 thousand in fiscal year 2000. The \\nRegional Ombudsman function is funded at roughly $1 million a year, \\nunder the ten Regional budgets.\\n\\n                     ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE PROGRAM\\n\\n    The National and Regional Ombudsmen receive many calls for \\nassistance each year--ranging from routine questions about hazardous \\nwaste laws to specific complaints about unfair practices conducted at a \\nsite or facility. The Agency has frequently adopted recommendations put \\nforth by the Ombudsman program. Before I close, I would like to share \\nwith you an example which demonstrates the success of the Ombudsman \\nprogram.\\n    In 1999, local residents asked the National Ombudsman to look into \\nthe EPA Superfund program activity associated with the Shattuck \\nChemical Site in Denver, Colorado. Community members did not feel the \\nremedy adequately protected public health and the environment. As part \\nof his investigation, the National Ombudsman held three hearings to \\nhear the concerns of community members. He also interviewed government \\nofficials, local residents, and EPA staff and reviewed the \\nadministrative record of the site. In October 1999, the National \\nOmbudsman issued his draft recommendations. Subsequently, EPA selected \\nan alternative remedy for the Shattuck Chemical Site.\\n    Is the program operating successfully? I believe so. Generally, as \\na result of the Ombudsman's involvement, a better decision is reached, \\ncommunities are satisfied with the outcome and public health and the \\nenvironment are protected. The Agency will continue to support the \\nOmbudsman function and make resources available so that it may continue \\nto assist communities across the nation.\\n\\n    Mr. Oxley. Thank you, Mr. Fields.\\n    Mr. Martin.\",\n",
       " 'Statement of robert martin': \"Mr. Martin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be \\nhere this morning to appear before you and the honorable \\nmembers of this committee.\\n    In speaking just extemporaneously for a moment, I have been \\ndoing this job for 8 years; and in the course of doing that job \\nI have talked to a lot of people, and I have met a lot of \\npeople all over the country and meeting with those people and \\nworking with them has enriched my life. I want to recognize \\nthem as I appear before you today, and I am very glad that you \\nwill be hearing from some of them in the course of this \\nhearing.\\n    I have a few things which I would like to speak to in the \\nspirit of doing our job better and in doing what the EPA must \\ndo, which is to protect human health and the environment, that \\nis its mission, particularly in the Superfund program. As we do \\nthat, I think it is critically important that we listen to \\npeople more, because I don't feel we have listened enough, and \\nit is a very hard job to do, to listen.\\n    I also feel that we need to be more compassionate, because \\nwe have so much power in the Superfund program. The Agency has \\nso much power in that program, and we need to feel how we \\naffect people's lives every day in the exercise of that power \\nor by not exercising that power.\\n    Third, I feel we need to be more thorough in our job. There \\nhave been countless times when I have undertaken cases in \\ndifferent parts of the Nation where I have heard that we have \\nmissed this or have missed that, and I think it is very \\nimportant to catch it all in the front end. I think that people \\nin the end want to know how big of a problem they are facing, \\nif they are facing one. They may not be able to fix it right \\naway, we may not have enough money, may not have enough \\nresources, it may take a long time, but we need to stay in a \\nplace of truth with that, with people. And also, obviously, \\nwhere there may not be a problem we should not be focusing \\nextraordinary resources to examine that.\\n    So with that being said, I am very honored to be before you \\ntoday and would be glad to respond to your questions, not only \\nin this session but individually as well as afterwards and \\nperhaps in meetings. Thank you sir.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Thank you, Mr. Martin, and job well done for 8 \\nyears. We appreciate your sincerity and your commitment to your \\njob.\\n    Mr. Fields, let me first indicate to you what appeared to \\nbe good news last week when the announcement came from U.S. EPA \\nthat the Keystone landfill site in Pennsylvania had been \\nadjudicated and there was a settlement, and what appeared to be \\non the surface very good news turned out to be, based on the \\ntiming at least, rather interesting, to say the least.\\n    Let me quote you from Mr. Campbell, Bradley M. Campbell, I \\nam sure you know the EPA Administrator for Pennsylvania, for \\neastern Pennsylvania. He says, quote, EPA is pleased to \\nconclude this extensive, expensive, contentious litigation. We \\nare eager to shift more of our attention and resources from the \\ncourtroom to cleanup--EPA Administrator Bradley Campbell--but \\nCongress still needs to address the basic deficiency in the \\nSuperfund that allowed this huge number of defendants to be \\nsued. And indeed there were over 130 original defendants that \\nballooned to 580 additional parties.\\n    He goes on to say, today's settlement reflects the \\nfundamental Superfund reforms which made it fair to the little \\nguys who never should have been sued by the large polluters in \\nthe first place, said Steve Herman, Assistant Administrator for \\nEPA's Office of Enforcement, Compliance and Assurance.\\n    Those quotes sound familiar, but most of those came from \\nthis side of the dais. By using these reforms, we protected \\nsmall waste contributors from costly third-party lawsuits and \\ndeterred similar litigation in future cases.\\n    It was particularly interesting because about that time, as \\nyou know, we were working with EPA to craft legislation that \\nwould not only take care of the small business folks at the \\nKeystone landfill, including the now famous Barbara Williams \\nand her restaurant, but indeed all of those folks who stood in \\ntheir shoes or stand to be in their shoes over the next few \\nyears unless we solve this incredible morass that has \\nencompassed many of these small business people whose only sin \\nwas sending chicken bones to the local landfill.\\n    Now, as you know, we had that legislation, H.R. 5175, on \\nthe floor last week, and we worked very hard in trying to \\nassuage some of the concerns that EPA had with the bill. But, \\nfrankly, I am disturbed that at the moment we thought we could \\nmove forward in a bipartisan manner your staff refused to meet \\nwith my staff, even though we requested a meeting to work on \\nsome of those changes. Matter of fact, the changes we made in \\nthe original legislation of the 1999 text were changes that EPA \\nhad requested.\\n    What I am going to do is give you a copy of the bill that \\nwas unable to secure two-thirds votes in the House last week \\nand ask you by the end of the week if you can make some written \\ncomments back to this committee as to why EPA chose to oppose \\nthis very common-sense legislation, particularly in the face of \\nstatements that came out of the EPA about--beating their chest \\nabout how successful they were in this settlement in \\nPennsylvania.\\n    I might also point out that, despite all of the apparent \\ngood work that was done, the aforementioned Barbara Williams, \\nin actuality this settlement does nothing for her. As a matter \\nof fact, it preserves the right of Waste Management to pursue \\ntheir suit against her.\\n    So let me first ask if you can provide us with some \\ninformation in that regard, regarding the legislation and how \\nit squares with that settlement in the statements therein, and \\nalso whether in fact that that is correct that Barbara Williams \\nis still subject to litigation after over 5 years in this \\npredicament.\\n    Mr. Fields. Okay. I will be happy to--the three points you \\nmade there, I will be happy to provide written comments back on \\nH.R. 5175 and the administration's concerns about elements of \\nthat bill that we would have, you know, we would have concerns \\nabout and we ran out of time.\\n    [The following was received for the record:]\\n\\n    Attached is a letter from Timothy Fields, Jr., Assistant \\nAdministrator, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, \\nwhich provides legislative language that addresses the \\nSuperfund liability of small parties.\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.029\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.030\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.031\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.032\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.033\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.034\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.035\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.036\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.037\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.038\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.039\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.040\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.041\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.042\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.043\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.044\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.045\\n\\n    Mr. Fields. Obviously, as the Administrator has said, Mr. \\nCongressman, as I have said many times, we do support targeted \\nSuperfund liability relief for small parties. However, this \\nbill was different than the one that we were working on in \\nterms of a draft last fall, and we ran out of time in terms of \\nbeing able to resolve all of our issues.\\n    We want to continue to work with this committee to provide \\nliability relief for small businesses, and we would like to \\ncontinue to work with you and others in Congress to do that in \\nthe future. However, we do have some concerns, and I think that \\nwas communicated in a letter the Administrator sent to \\nCongress, went to Congressman Tauzin and others on September \\n22.\\n    Two other points you made and I want to make clear, and I \\nthink this is a comment that Congressman Shimkus alluded to in \\nhis opening remarks. I want to make very clear that the \\nstatement is not correct about the Keystone settlement and the \\nvulnerability of Barbara Williams' former restaurant. My \\nunderstanding is that she has now sold that restaurant.\\n    But in the consent decree, we explicitly required that the \\nselling parties, Waste Management, the Noels, they would have \\nto waive their claims against all parties, including the \\nnonsettlers like Barbara Williams. We included similar waivers \\nin our prior settlements with the original generator \\ndefendants, the selling third and fourth parties and the de \\nmicromis parties.\\n    The truth is, we have done everything in our power to \\nprotect Barbara Williams and those who are similarly situated. \\nNo one who settled with EPA can sue any of the nonsettlers. So \\nwe want to clarify that, because we have seen some statements \\nby NFIB which were incorrect on that point.\\n    Mr. Oxley. If I could interject, that statement came from \\nEPA, not from NFIB; is that correct?\\n    Mr. Fields. No. EPA is trying to set the record straight. \\nWe saw a statement from NFIB that, despite that settlement \\nsigned on Keystone, that Waste Management could still sue \\nBarbara Williams.\\n    I want to set the record straight and say EPA's position is \\nand the settlement language says specifically--if you want I \\ncan give you the cite; it is in section 24, paragraphs 179 \\nthrough 185--it makes very explicitly clear that the selling \\nparties cannot sue Mrs. Williams or any other nonsettlers as \\npart of this consent decree that has been signed. That is our \\nposition. That is our reading of that consent decree.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Now is your reading of our bill that Barbara \\nWilliams and all of those folks would be relieved of liability \\nstraight up?\\n    Mr. Fields. Your bill and that particular element of your \\nbill that you sponsored, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 5175, it would \\nsolve the problem of the small business like Barbara Williams \\nwho generated----\\n    Mr. Oxley. How come we couldn't get 290 votes for it?\\n    Mr. Fields. H.R. 5175 was not the same bill that we were \\ndiscussing.\\n    Mr. Oxley. No, it wasn't. Actually, we accommodated EPA on \\nseveral issues, including, if I might point out, applying the \\nde micromis exemption prospectively.\\n    Now do you agree that H.R. 5175 addresses this concern? \\nBecause that was the concern that we were told by EPA--and we \\nspecifically addressed that.\\n    Mr. Fields. Mr. Chairman, you did address that concern.\\n    I do want to point out, though, that the bill we were \\ndiscussing with NFIB, that was not really a bill but a draft \\nproposal of October, 1999, that was different than H.R. 5175, \\nwas introduced this session. It is true that you and your staff \\nworked with us heroically to try to address a lot of our \\nconcerns. We do still have some lingering concerns, though.\\n    For example, the Administrator is concerned that the burden \\nof proof has shifted to the government. The government must \\nprove that a business that sent over a hundred pounds of \\nwaste--that a business that sent over a hundred pounds of waste \\nis not exempt.\\n    You know, I will give you comments specifically on the bill \\nthis week, but there were elements in this bill that we could \\nstill not support.\\n    Mr. Oxley. So it is EPA's position that the burden of proof \\nshould be on Barbara Williams and not on the Federal \\nGovernment, is that your position?\\n    Mr. Fields. Well, we don't think that the government----\\n    Mr. Oxley. Is that yes or no? Is that yes or no?\\n    Mr. Fields. The answer is, we do not believe that the \\ngovernment should have to prove that a business sent over a \\nhundred pounds of waste.\\n    Mr. Oxley. That is a unique and very interesting theory in \\nAmerican law. Because you know when I went to law school a long \\ntime ago, we studied that people were innocent until proven \\nguilty and that the burden lay on the government to prove that \\nthose people were indeed guilty. So, basically, the EPA is \\nturning this legal concept on its head, is it not?\\n    Mr. Fields. Well, the problem, Mr. Chairman, is that \\noftentimes the business records are not--oftentimes not \\navailable. This would cause litigation because we would be \\ndisputing whether or not----\\n    Mr. Oxley. You wouldn't want litigation. We certainly \\nhaven't had a whole lot of litigation.\\n    Mr. Fields. We want to avoid that, and we think this \\nparticular element of the bill would encourage litigation.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Would encourage litigation. You mean, even more \\nlitigation than we already have?\\n    Mr. Fields. Because of the unavailability of adequate \\nrecords to document how much material actually went to a \\nmaterial site.\\n    Mr. Chairman, we will be happy to give you some comments by \\nthe end of the week as you request on your bill, but I wanted \\nyou to share with you that, as the Administrator said in her \\nletter, there are elements like that we believe would increase \\ntransaction costs and promote litigation. We will be happy to \\ngive you a letter for the record that gives you specific \\nelements of how we believe that bill, H.R. 5175, would promote \\nlitigation and increase transaction costs. That is what you are \\nrequesting. We are willing to do that.\\n    Mr. Oxley. This is, as the Four Tops sang, ``the same old \\nsong,'' Mr. Fields, 1965, I think, by the way.\\n    Mr. Fields. I heard it.\\n    Mr. Oxley. But we have been through this, and it just seems \\nto me from where I sit that our efforts to try to make some \\ncommon sense in this Superfund law which we have been at for it \\nseems my entire adult life, it is always a moving target. If it \\nis not the de micromis settlement prospectively, then it is \\nburden of proof.\\n    So I get the sense that we are in a game where the goal \\nposts keep being moved on us, even like Charlie Brown, where we \\nget set to kick the field goal and Lucy, a/k/a Carol, pulls a \\nfootball out and I end up flat on my keister.\\n    You know, I am getting pretty damn tired of that. It is the \\nsame old story. We try to get a reasonable bill on the floor of \\nthe House that was supported by virtually all Republicans and \\n46 or so Democrats, that made a lot of sense and would get \\nthese small business people out of the litigation nightmare, \\nnot create more litigation, create less litigation. This is not \\nbrain surgery here. Yet we found a situation where we couldn't \\nget it done because somebody had a political agenda, and I just \\nfind that unfortunate.\\n    Let me yield to the gentlelady from Colorado.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Let me just say that that particular bill, H.R. 5175, when \\nit came to the floor was not a bill that the minority had seen \\nor had the opportunity to work on. People like me really felt \\nlike it was a good step toward resolving some of these \\nliabilities for the small folks like the restaurant owners who \\nhave been mentioned today and others. However, there were some \\nother details in the bill that were really problematic.\\n    I think we could have worked those details out had we known \\nabout it before it came to the floor, but, as we all know, \\nSuperfund is very technical. There is a long established body \\nof law, and the last thing we want to do is upset the equities \\nin existing laws which would encourage litigation.\\n    So I would offer--Mr. Chairman, for next year I would offer \\npersonally to work with you on this issue. It is an issue, as \\nyou know, I have worked on a lot; and I will guarantee you if \\nwe come up with an agreement I won't pull the football out and \\nleave you on your keister.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Thank you.\\n    Ms. DeGette. You are welcome, Charlie.\\n    Let me get back to the topic at hand a little bit. I would \\nlike to ask Mr. Fields, you heard me talk in my opening \\nstatement about these new findings by the Department of Energy \\nabout some States that processed radioactive materials; and I \\nam wondering if the recent disclosure by the DOE needs to be \\ninvestigated by the EPA as regards the Shattuck site so that we \\ncan properly characterize and dispose of the waste.\\n    Mr. Fields. Yes, Congressman DeGette, we are including \\nShattuck. We initially, through the USA Today article, had \\nidentified 153 sites. We have now discovered in discussions \\nwith DOE several hundred others. We are investigating all those \\nsites, one of which was Shattuck; and the Department of Energy \\nis also doing a file review on a parallel track to determine \\nwhat information they have about this waste disposal area so--\\nas well.\\n    So I assure you there is an ongoing investigation by EPA, \\nDOE and others trying to assess exactly what is the situation \\nregarding radiation waste at Shattuck in light of this \\ndisclosure in recent weeks.\\n    Ms. DeGette. How will this affect the timetable for removal \\nof waste at Shattuck?\\n    Mr. Fields. We don't believe it will affect, in any way, \\nthe timetable for removal of waste. We are in the design phase \\nright now. We committed to the community we would have this \\nmaterial moving away within 2 years. That is the same time \\nschedule we are on. We are doing this effort aggressively, on a \\nparallel track, with the design being done.\\n    We will have to make sure, however, the waste is properly \\ncharacterized. Any waste that goes offsite will have to be \\ncharacterized to determine exactly what is there and whether or \\nnot the facility we are going to take it to is properly \\nlicensed to take that material. So it is critical we get this \\ninvestigation that you alluded to done quickly. So that can \\nfactor into the schedule for moving this material offsite.\\n    Ms. DeGette. But it is your view today the removal schedule \\nshould not be affected.\\n    Mr. Fields. We do not intend for the removal schedule to be \\nupdated.\\n    Ms. DeGette. I think that is pretty clear.\\n    Mr. Martin, let me ask you if you have any sense why your \\noffice's investigation of the Shattuck site did not uncover any \\nof the information that the DOE just released.\\n    Mr. Martin. When I undertook my review of the Shattuck \\nsite, which began last June, we did meet with officials from \\nthe company, this W.S. Shattuck Company, were provided a tour \\nof the site; and since that time I can tell you I have had \\nsuspicions that the waste at the site was other than as \\ndescribed on the basis of questions that we have asked and also \\non the basis of documents that we reviewed in the \\nadministrative record in the region. It is a concern that we \\nhave had, and we are investigating.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Mr. Martin, to follow up a little bit, I know \\nthat there were a number of statements by you and by the chief \\ninvestigator about potential criminal activity at the Shattuck \\nsite made in the press and other places. I am wondering if, to \\nyour knowledge, there have been any reports made to local law \\nenforcement or Federal law enforcement officials about criminal \\nactivity or anything you have uncovered at the site.\\n    Mr. Martin. I made no statements about potential criminal \\nactivity in the course of the hearings which we undertook for \\nthe Shattuck site. However, to the extent we have any reason to \\nbelieve through our review of the record or otherwise by \\ntalking to officials within the region, the State or the \\ncompany that there may be, you know, criminal activity, we will \\nrefer them to the Inspector General of the EPA.\\n    Ms. DeGette. But to your knowledge no referrals have made \\nto date.\\n    Mr. Martin. I have made no such referral.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Thank you.\\n    Let me ask you generally, I know the ABA is looking at \\ngeneral Ombudsman standards and the subcommittee issued a \\nreport this past July to the American Bar Association House of \\nDelegates recommending a set of standards for the Ombudsman \\noffice to follow.\\n    On the one hand, the recommendations stated that the \\nOmbudsman should not conduct an investigation that substitutes \\nfor administrative or judicial proceedings; and an Ombudsman \\nreview should not serve as the foundation for disciplinary \\nactivity or civil action or a determination of a violation of \\nlaw or policy. The report goes on to say, and, by the way, the \\nsubcommittee says that the ABA supports the greater use of \\nombudsmen; and it says that ombudsmen should review allegations \\nof unfairness, maladministration, discourteous behavior, \\nincivility, inappropriate application of law or policy, \\ninefficiency or decision unsupported by fact.\\n    I am wondering, Mr. Fields, if you can tell me, does the \\nEPA Ombudsman follow these guidelines? And if not, do they \\nintend to in the draft report that you are working on? And if \\nnot, tell me how it operates differently.\\n    Mr. Fields. Well, the EPA has looked at the American Bar \\nAssociation Ombudsman guidelines. We have looked at this report \\nthat you have referred to as well. We are looking at all those \\nsources. We are looking at the guidelines of the U.S. Ombudsman \\nAssociation. We are looking at those elements of those \\nguidelines that are the best components, and we intend to apply \\nthose and incorporate those into the EPA guidance we are \\ndeveloping that we will make available to the public shortly.\\n    We think there are certain elements of those guidelines \\nthat fit the EPA structure, but there are some elements that do \\nnot. Complete confidentiality, for example. We cannot provide \\ncomplete independence, for example. We are working to try to \\nmake sure those elements of those various models that have been \\npublished by various organizations including ABA are \\nincorporated into our guidance that we are developing and make \\nsure that they are compatible with Federal law and EPA policy \\nand procedure.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Mr. Martin, would you have any comment on \\nthat?\\n    Mr. Martin. Yes, I would.\\n    I served and still serve on the Working Committee for the \\nAmerican Bar Association for Ombudsmen, and I was integrally \\ninvolved in the development of the language which you have \\nspoken of just a moment ago. And I think the direct point is \\nthat once an Ombudsman becomes an adjudicatory body it is no \\nlonger an Ombudsman. Therefore, an Ombudsman cannot be a judge, \\ncannot make recommendations which are binding upon the entity \\nthat it reviews. This function has never done that and I don't \\nbelieve ever will.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Gentlelady's time has expired.\\n    The gentleman from Florida, the chairman of the Health \\nSubcommittee.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will just \\ncontinue in that vein.\\n    In 1990, as I understand it, the Administrative Conference \\nfor the United States recommended that all government agencies \\nwith frequent contact with the public consider establishing an \\nOmbudsman service. The conference also indicated that, and I \\nquote, Mr. Fields, ``it is important that Ombudsmen be \\nindependent of the line offices and that they are seen as \\nindependent.''\\n    Well let me just say, this is difficult. It is difficult \\nfor those of us who have worked with, and developed \\nrelationships with, the Ombudsmen over many months, to get them \\nin a position where they are sitting here to the right hand of \\ntheir boss, not under oath and asking them to basically say \\nwhat is in their hearts. And in all honesty--that makes it very \\ndifficult for me.\\n    Because, let me just put it this way, Mr. Fields, with all \\ndue respect--this is not intended to be any kind of a threat or \\ncoercion or anything of that nature. I don't really know what \\nMr. Martin is going to testify to here today. He was asked to \\ntestify, and apparently accepted the invitation to testify. \\nOrdinarily, a written statement is submitted to this committee \\nprior to that testimony. We did not receive a written \\nstatement. We were told he was not going to be able to testify. \\nThen, of course, this morning he is here to make an oral \\nstatement. You know, a reasonable person would certainly read \\nan awful lot into all of that.\\n    I would hope that no matter what happens here today or \\nduring the process of reauthorizing and maybe putting into law \\nspecifics in terms of the functions of the Ombudsman, that \\nthere would not be any repercussions on Mr. Martin or any \\nmembers of his staff. And I know that you will tell me there \\nwon't be, but you and I know that sometimes things are said and \\nother things happen, whether the person who made the comment \\nmeans it or not.\\n    You were asked, Mr. Martin, to testify before this \\ncommittee. You did not provide a written statement. Now you are \\nhere today to speak orally. Is there anything you would like to \\nshare with this committee in that regard? It is true you were \\ninvited to testify.\\n    Mr. Martin. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. It is true that you planned to testify.\\n    Mr. Martin. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. And it is true that that changed and then \\nthis morning you are to give an oral statement.\\n    Mr. Martin. There was confusion, Mr. Chairman, about the \\nsubmission of testimony to the committee. I had a discussion \\nwith our Office of Congressional Affairs in which they \\nindicated that a statement or statements would be prepared for \\nMr. Fields and myself. That discussion occurred around \\nSeptember 23. I then understand from my staff that there had \\nbeen a joint statement prepared by the Agency as late----\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Joint statement for the two of you.\\n    Mr. Martin. Yes, sir, yeah. That had been prepared by the \\nAgency.\\n    Mr. Martin. Yes, and as of last evening, in fact, the joint \\nstatement was still prepared; and then I understand a statement \\nwas submitted that was from Mr. Fields alone.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Did you feel that you should provide your \\nown statement?\\n    Mr. Martin. I feel the Office of Ombudsman--I feel, as \\nOmbudsman, that I should be able to provide my own statement to \\nthis committee. I understand that because of legal difficulties \\nwithin the agency, perhaps the administration, any such \\nstatement would have to be cleared through the Office of \\nManagement and Budget and perhaps other entities as well. I \\nunderstand those difficulties. But to answer your question, \\nyes, I do feel I should be able to.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Had you prepared your own statement and went \\nthrough the process and just didn't make it through the \\nprocess?\\n    Mr. Martin. No, sir. I was led to believe that a joint \\nstatement would be prepared and submitted.\\n    Mr. Fields. Mr. Chairman, could I enter this one and \\nclarify this, just to add to this question?\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. I suppose so.\\n    Mr. Fields. Mr. Martin--and I--and we apologize. There was \\nsome confusion. Mr. Martin was on leave, and we did talk to \\nstaff in the Ombudsman. We assumed that one statement from the \\nadministration--obviously, Mr. Martin was not restricted in any \\nway from being able to communicate with this committee.\\n    We traditionally prepare one statement that allows several \\nwitnesses--whether it is me and Steve Herman or me and Lois \\nSchiffer--when we get letters from committees of Congress we \\ntraditionally put together one statement and have both \\nwitnesses there to respond to questions. But I assure you there \\nwas not any attempt to try to stifle a statement from the \\nOmbudsman.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Mr. Fields, with all due respect, again, I \\ndon't think there is any confusion. The letter of invitation is \\nright here; and it is pretty darn clear, the form of your \\ntestimony and that sort of thing.\\n    You know, it gets again to the independence aspect. It gets \\nto the problems that led up to this hearing, the problems that \\nwe ran into in our different sites in Denver, in Idaho and \\nFlorida, et cetera.\\n    You know, you made the comment, sir, that the Ombudsman's \\nOffice is operating very successfully. Maybe some people would \\nsay in the eyes of EPA maybe too successfully. You know, I was \\npart of this committee when we did the Superfund bill, as was \\nMr. Oxley. Not too many people up here were here at this time.\\n    The Superfund bill took up all hours of several days and \\nnights, and it was a very contentious type of a thing. It \\nshouldn't have been, I suppose, but it was because partisanship \\nalways plays a part. But I do remember very clearly back when \\nthe Ombudsman concept was being brought up and a lot of us \\nended up supporting the Superfund bill; and many people who, \\nfrankly, were being blasted by various special interest groups \\nwere thanked after it all was done.\\n    But in my mind I am not sure they understood what the role \\nof the Ombudsman would be in Superfund program, and I sure \\nunderstand it now from what I have seen in Tarpon Springs. \\nThank God for it and thank God for those people who--I wasn't \\none of them--came up with the concept. I suppose I supported \\nit. I can't remember back to 1984. But my point is it has \\nprobably worked too well from what I have seen.\\n    Now, you know, we have seen documentation, Mr. Fields, \\nbasically withholding funds from the Ombudsman's office. Maybe \\nthey are doing their job too darn well. I don't want this to be \\na militant type of hearing. Do you agree that the Ombudsman--as \\nyou have stated, Mr. Fields, is not an advocate for a community \\nor any person or institution? That is in your testimony. I \\nbelieve you have said that.\\n    Mr. Fields. That is in my testimony. That is my statement.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. It has also been in some of the \\ncommunications I have read that your office sent out. Mr. \\nMartin, do you agree with that?\\n    Mr. Martin. An Ombudsman should not serve as an advocate \\nfor any particular person but can serve as an advocate for--to \\nbe frank, the truth, after an investigation is under way or has \\nbeen performed and I may find facts that I believe are \\nundeniable and if I feel those facts are being ignored by the \\nAgency, I then advocate for those facts.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. When you feel that way, what sort of \\nresponse are you accustomed to receiving from the Agency?\\n    Mr. Martin. Well, the process at times can be long and \\narduous, but I feel that over the course of the past 8 years \\nthe Agency has adopted many of my recommendations--I would say \\n70 to 80 percent.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Mr. Fields, just one last question. My time \\nhas expired. I appreciate the Chair's indulgence. Do you agree \\nthat the Office of the Ombudsman should be reauthorized?\\n    Mr. Fields. We have no problem with the Office of the \\nOmbudsman being reauthorized. We do have concerns with some of \\nthe legislative proposals, though, that would add elements to \\nthat reauthorization.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. In other words, you feel that your agency \\nshould continue to control their actions.\\n    Mr. Fields. No. We think, though, that the ABA model \\nstatute is not the appropriate guideline to embody as the \\noverarching body for the Ombudsman activities. We think there \\nare elements of those provisions that cause problems for a \\nFederal Government Ombudsman, but we support the Ombudsman \\nfunction being reauthorized. We think it is a valuable \\nfunction. We would continue to operate this function \\nirrespective of whether or not Congress reauthorizes this \\nlegislation.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. I would like to get into funding and that \\nsort of thing. My time has expired.\\n    There will be further questions that I and others will be \\nsubmitting to you; hopefully, you will respond to those in due \\ntime.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am sorry to have taken up so \\nmuch time.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Time of the gentleman has expired.\\n    Chair now recognizes gentleman from Wisconsin first, right? \\nNo, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Sawyer.\\n    Mr. Sawyer. Mr. Chairman, I was worried that you had \\nforgotten where I was from for a second there.\\n    First of all, let me say thank you to both of you gentlemen \\nfor being here. It is good to see you both.\\n    Let me direct my first question to a matter of specific \\nhistory within my district regarding the industrial excess \\nlandfill. Back in 1997 the concerned citizens of Lake Township, \\nwho had been working on the issues surrounding that site for \\nsome time, asked then Senator John Glenn and me to intervene on \\ntheir behalf with the Agency to allow them to conduct tests of \\nsoil and water site. After more than 6 months, in August 1997, \\nwe obtained permission for the testing to begin. I thought that \\nwas particularly--a particularly good idea because up to that \\ntime test results had been problematic.\\n    Just about the time that the test permission was obtained, \\nthat same citizens group determined that it really did not want \\nto undertake tests. Instead, they requested a review by the \\nOmbudsman. That request was denied, and I pressed for the \\nOmbudsman's participation. Senator Glenn at that point withdrew \\nfrom that request, feeling that until the tests had actually \\nbeen conducted he didn't want to pursue another avenue of \\ninquiry.\\n    I had hoped at the time that the Ombudsman could become in \\nits very special way an active participant, not just reviewing \\nthe history of the site but, more importantly, in examining the \\nsite to decide how best to protect the public health and safety \\nand the confidence of the residents in the area. So I pleaded \\nthe case with Administrator Browner, and the Ombudsman was \\ngiven permission for a preliminary review in September 1998.\\n    Mr. Martin, you advised me that your findings would be \\navailable shortly. You came to my office in October 1998 and \\nrepeated the same assertion. In January 1999, you conducted a \\nhearing, all of which I am very grateful for. We met again in \\nthe spring of 2000 in May of this year when you suggested that \\nyour findings were imminent. Can you tell me what shortly or \\nimminent means?\\n    Mr. Martin. Means this week, sir.\\n    Mr. Sawyer. Does it mean this week?\\n    Mr. Martin. Yes.\\n    Mr. Sawyer. I am looking forward to that. It has been \\nfrustrating as you, I am sure, can appreciate, particularly as \\nwe have seen other avenues of resolution move forward along \\nparallel tracks.\\n    Mr. Fields, has it been your experience that this kind of \\ntimetable is normal?\\n    Mr. Fields. Well, obviously, the Ombudsman has a lot of \\nmajor cases that are before him. I am sure that Mr. Martin has \\nbeen--being the good public servant he is--is trying to balance \\nall those priorities he has to deal with. He has a number of \\ncases involving Superfund and RCRA sites across the country, \\nand many members on these two subcommittees are aware of those \\ncases. So I know that the history of the IEL matters go back \\nmore than 10 years.\\n    I do want to say one of the reasons it took a while to even \\ninitiate the Ombudsman review was because this site, as you \\nknow, has been subject to four major reviews even before the \\nOmbudsman got involved--the Science Advisory Board, the Office \\nof Inspector General, Clean Sites Incorporated, EPA's radiation \\nlabs. So it is probably one of the most studied Superfund sites \\nin the history of EPA.\\n    But--I look forward to the Ombudsman's report, but I do \\nknow that, you know, Mr. Martin does have to balance a lot of \\nmajor cases all going on at the same time in trying to make \\njudgments as to which ones he does first, but sometimes the \\ncases do get delayed necessarily just because of the need to \\nbalance competing priorities across the country.\\n    Mr. Sawyer. Mr. Martin, do you have a comment?\\n    Mr. Martin. Yes, sir.\\n    I thank you for your patience and your forbearance. I also \\nthank you for your intervention. Because when the request for \\nmy help came from citizens in your community, I was denied by \\nAdministrator Browner, and you did intervene, and that was a \\nsuccessful intervention.\\n    Since that time, yes, I have done a public hearing in the \\ncommunity. I have completed my review of the reviews that Mr. \\nFields had just spoken of, and I am prepared to sit down with \\nyou this week and give you my preliminary recommendations.\\n    Mr. Sawyer. I look forward to counselling with both of you \\nwhen that report becomes available. Thank you very much.\\n    Mr. Martin. The issue of resources----\\n    Mr. Sawyer. I do understand that.\\n    Mr. Chairman, I have been asked to pose one further \\nquestion by the staff, if I might. The question revolves around \\nthe question of whether the Ombudsman and his employees have \\narrest powers and the right to take an individual into custody. \\nThis centers around an event on June 5 in a town meeting in St. \\nPetersburg, Florida, where the chief investigator is \\ncharacterized here as giving the Miranda warning to two EPA \\nemployees from Region 4.\\n    I am not an attorney, but to my knowledge that warning is \\nonly given in the case of a criminal investigation. Was this \\nintended to be a Miranda warning? Let me read it to you from \\nthe record.\\n    The chief investigator speaking said, you have the right to \\nremain silent. You have the right to counsel. Anything you say \\nmay be used against you in a court of law. Proceed to the \\nwitness.\\n    Mr. Fields. Is that for me or Mr. Martin?\\n    Mr. Sawyer. It is for both of you.\\n    Mr. Fields. Your question is, does the Ombudsman function \\nhave subpoena powers or----\\n    Mr. Sawyer. Or arrest powers.\\n    Mr. Fields. The Ombudsman function, as currently \\nconstituted, does not have those authorities or powers.\\n    Mr. Sawyer. What would be the purpose of a Miranda warning \\nthen?\\n    Mr. Fields. I will have to defer to Mr. Martin on that. I \\nwas not at the hearing. I will let Mr. Martin speak to the \\npurpose of the statement on June 5.\\n    Mr. Martin. I will be glad to respond, sir.\\n    To be clear, no, the Office of Ombudsman--the Ombudsman \\nfunction has no arrest powers, has no detention powers, does \\nnot do criminal investigations.\\n    I want to get to the specific point of what was said in the \\ncontext of the hearing that I did in Tarpon Springs, Florida, \\nearlier this year where the issue of the warning arose.\\n    Prior to that meeting, Mr. Kaufman, who serves as my chief \\ninvestigator, had met with staff from our Office of Inspector \\nGeneral with whom I have had a working relationship for many \\nyears in many cases; and I have done criminal referrals to the \\nOffice of Inspector General. Mr. Kaufman was advised--and I \\nwould also like to note that he has really the firsthand \\ntestimony which can be provided on this issue--was advised, and \\nhe is present behind me, that it may be necessary for us to \\ngive certain warnings to preserve a potential criminal case \\nthat the IG would do in the event we made a referral after \\ncompletion of our investigation.\\n    Since that time, the Office of Inspector General, at our \\nrequest and at the request of Mr. Fields, has provided us with \\na memorandum of instruction on when warnings can be issued.\\n    Mr. Sawyer. Thank you very much.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Would you yield?\\n    Mr. Sawyer. I would, but if you could share with us that \\ninstruction.\\n    Mr. Fields. We will be happy to share this for the record. \\nIt is a memo dated September 12, 2000, from the Office of \\nInspector General that we will be happy to provide for the \\nrecord. Mr. Kaufman has also provided a response to this memo \\nas well, and those could be provided for the record to this--to \\nboth subcommittees.\\n    [The following was received for the record:]\\n\\n    Attached are two memorandum, the first is from Mark Bialek, \\nCounsel to the Inspector General to Michael Shapiro, Principal \\nDeputy Assistant Administrator. The second is from Hugh \\nKaufman, Senior Engineer to Mark Bialek. These memorandum \\nexplain the EPA Inspector General's position in regard to \\nwhether the OSWER National Ombudsman has subpoena or arrest \\npower.\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.046\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.047\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.048\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.049\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.050\\n\\n    Mr. Sawyer. Let me yield to the gentlelady.\\n    Ms. DeGette. If the gentleman would yield, I, in fact, am a \\nlawyer and used to do a fair amount of criminal work.\\n    Frankly, the administration of the Miranda warning by \\nsomeone who has no law enforcement or administrative authority \\nis not going to be meaningful at all in a court of law. Because \\na knowing waiver can't be made by anybody who might give \\nperjurious testimony or testimony that would cause them to \\nself-incriminate. So, therefore, I would suggest, Mr. Fields, \\nwhen you develop your new standards you include this issue in \\nyour new standards. Because unless you have an agent of a \\nFederal, local or State law enforcement agency to administer \\nthe Miranda warning, this isn't going to have any effect \\nanyway.\\n    Mr. Fields. I agree--Mr. Chairman, I will respond quickly.\\n    I agree with that, and it has been clarified now in this \\nmemorandum that came from the Office of Inspector General that \\nonly qualified Office of Inspector General personnel and \\ncriminal enforcement division personnel from the Office of \\nEnforcement have the power and the authority to conduct \\ninvestigation of potential criminal violations and \\nadministrative misconduct and issue such warnings, as you just \\npointed out; and that will be made explicitly clear in future \\nguidance.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Gentleman's time has expired.\\n    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. \\nShimkus.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Martin, I am glad that you are here. You have a very \\ngentle spirit, and I say that with all due compliments because \\nI think you probably need it in that job.\\n    Also, we, as Members of Congress, there are 435 ombudsmen, \\nand this is our job and in many different areas. This is why I \\nhave taken on the Quincy issue so fervently. I find it hard to \\nbe an effective Ombudsman if you are not even allowed to \\nprovide your own written statement. How can you be totally \\nindependent?\\n    I understand that it would have to get vetted through some \\nfolks, but I just find that symptomatic of a problem that \\nreally, Mr. Fields, I hope you end up addressing at some time.\\n    Mr. Martin, who is giving you advice behind your--who is \\nthe gentleman behind you with the beard and glasses and from \\nwhat office does he come from?\\n    Mr. Martin. It is Mr. Kaufman with the Office of Solid \\nWaste and Emergency Response which Mr. Fields is representing \\nand which I am in, and he has served as my chief investigator \\nin a number of cases.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Is he in the Office of the Ombudsman or is he \\nin Mr. Fields' office?\\n    Mr. Martin. He is technically in Mr. Fields' office, \\nbecause my position description is such that I have no \\nauthority to supervise any EPA employees.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. I thank you. I think that is also a telling \\nissue of some independence or lack thereof.\\n    Mr. Fields, how many times have I asked for some language \\nfrom you in a hearing of this sort to relieve small business, \\nprovide them some liability protection? I can remember two \\ntimes, and I can remember two times you providing the \\naffirmative action assurance that you would provide me or this \\ncommittee some language. Have I ever received language?\\n    Mr. Fields. We have worked on language with committee \\nstaff, Mr. Congressman. I don't recall us providing language \\nspecifically to you. I do know that we had worked on language, \\nbut I don't recall whether we provided it.\\n    I would just make one quick--this will be 30 seconds--just \\nto clarify that Mr. Martin, his statement would not have to be \\ncleared by any of the administration to submit a statement. \\nThat is not a requirement we have in terms of Mr. Martin \\nbeing----\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Let us don't go there because, obviously, it \\ndidn't happen today.\\n    I would like to place in the record statements from the \\nNFIB concerning EPA's lack of leadership on small business \\nrelief legislation.\\n    [The information follows:]\\n\\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.051\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.052\\n    \\n    Mr. Shimkus. I would also like to show you--and I am \\nreferring to Mr. Fields--and place in the record some draft \\ntext that we were provided in November 1999.\\n    [The information referred to follows:]\\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.153\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.053\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.054\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.055\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.056\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.057\\n    \\n    Mr. Shimkus. On top of the first copy of the fax line, it \\nsays the Office of Administrator at EPA. The first copy is \\nincomplete. So I have an additional complete copy that has both \\nEPA and NFIB's name on the fax lines, and I want to know very \\nclearly with a yes or no, if possible, was this paper produced \\nat the EPA after discussions with the EPA?\\n    Mr. Fields. This is November, 19--I see it says November 3, \\n1999.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. November 3, 1999, EPA, AO and then--the same \\nline--with another line from NFIB Government Relations.\\n    Mr. Fields. I provided a letter for the record August 18, \\n2000 which said that NFIB and EPA had developed some language \\nin November 1999. I don't know if this is the specific same \\nlanguage, but I assume this is close to or similar to language \\nthat we were working on at the time with NFIB staff and EPA \\nstaff. I would have to read this carefully and verify for you \\nto know if that was exact same language, but I know we were \\nworking on language at the time.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Please do because we obviously believe that it \\nis the same language and that really this committee has moved \\nin great strides to try to meet many of the EPA's demands and \\nespecially in the bill we had on the floor.\\n    The bill addresses a relationship with entities to parents, \\nsubsidiaries and affiliates as requested by the EPA. The bill \\naddressed the potential effect of the bill on concluded actions \\nas requested by administration staff. The bill withdraws \\nliability protections if a small business fails to comply with \\nadministrator support orders to compel compliance with requests \\nfor information as requested by\\n    EPA. The bill narrows the definition of households as \\nrequested by the EPA.\\n    Finally, at the request of the Administrator's staff, the \\nbill makes clear that settlement offers must be in the public \\ninterest.\\n    I mean, we have moved really very far to meet your desires. \\nI think the chairman's frustration has been experienced by \\nmyself, too, is we just want to know what you want. I mean, \\nthat is all. I think that is pretty clear.\\n    So I want to follow up on the chairman's request that you \\ntake 5175 and tell us what you want; and if you can do that by \\nthe end of this week we may be able to run another shot at this \\non the floor.\\n    As an Ombudsman for the citizens in my District--and I tell \\nmy colleagues and I said this on the floor--their time will \\ncome. Their time will come when the local restaurant owner is \\nbeing the third party of a suit. As I mentioned in the opening \\nstatement, they will be in that block of 580 that are the third \\niteration of a suit in which their net income for the year will \\nbe at risk, either through a settlement offer by the EPA or \\ncountless litigation to get them out of this fund, and we have \\nall agreed they don't need to be there.\\n    So since we are going to have probably another week here in \\nWashington, we do have time to fix this; and so I will take you \\nat your word that you----\\n    Mr. Fields. We will provide comments, yes, Chairman Oxley.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Not just comments. We are not asking for \\ncomments anymore. We are done with comments.\\n    Mr. Fields. That is what the chairman----\\n    Mr. Shimkus. No, he didn't. He wants legislative language. \\nHe wants language that you would approve in a bill to exempt \\nsmall businesses from this trap.\\n    You know, the Administrator's position on this and the \\nfailure to fight for small businesses, to say that it would \\nexpand litigation, is the biggest red herring I have ever \\nheard, when the whole intent is to leave liability--the whole \\nintent of the----\\n    Mr. Fields. There are elements of the bill----\\n    Mr. Shimkus. [continuing] language. We don't want \\noverviews. We don't want synopses. We want legislative language \\nto fix the bill, and I will take you at your word.\\n    With that, Mr. Chairman, I will yield back my time.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Gentleman yields back.\\n    The Chair now recognize the gentlelady from Wyoming, Ms. \\nCubin.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. Mr. Chairman, I don't have any questions at \\nthat time.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Then the Chair turns to the gentleman from \\nOklahoma, Mr. Largent.\\n    Mr. Largent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have some \\nquestions.\\n    Mr. Martin, when you were asked a question earlier you said \\nthat you believe that your office was an advocate for the \\ntruth. And the question I had for you when you said that was do \\nyou feel if the Ombudsman's Office is controlled or manipulated \\nby the EPA that you can still pursue the truth?\\n    Mr. Martin. No.\\n    Mr. Largent. Okay. Did you have written testimony prepared \\nfor this hearing this morning?\\n    Mr. Martin. No.\\n    Mr. Largent. You never had a testimony prepared for this \\nhearing.\\n    Mr. Martin. That is correct.\\n    Mr. Largent. Did you seek permission to provide testimony \\nfor this hearing when asked?\\n    Mr. Martin. I understood it was being prepared by the \\nAgency.\\n    Mr. Largent. Which agency?\\n    Mr. Martin. The EPA.\\n    Mr. Largent. The invitation went to you, and the Agency \\nbegan preparing the testimony for you, is that what you are \\nsaying?\\n    Mr. Martin. That was my understanding, yes.\\n    Mr. Largent. Did you not think that that was odd or is that \\nnormal operating procedure, that your testimony that you would \\nprovide before this hearing would be provided by the Agency or \\nperhaps the gentleman that is sitting behind you?\\n    Mr. Martin. I did not receive the invitation letter \\ndirectly.\\n    Mr. Largent. Did your office receive an invitation \\ndirectly? Because we have a copy of it. Maybe there is a \\nproblem with the Postal Service. Maybe we can get them here.\\n    Mr. Martin. We did receive the invitation, I believe, \\nyesterday; and it had been opened.\\n    Mr. Largent. It had been opened.\\n    Mr. Martin. Yes before we received the invitation.\\n    Mr. Largent. Who opened the invitation?\\n    Mr. Martin. I don't know, sir.\\n    Mr. Largent. Do other people routinely open your mail \\nbefore you receive it?\\n    Mr. Fields. Mailroom--EPA's mailroom opens the mail \\noftentimes when it comes in, letters.\\n    Mr. Largent. Well, Mr. Martin, have you had a chance to \\nread the testimony that the Agency provided for this hearing?\\n    Mr. Martin. Yes, I reviewed it this morning prior to the \\nhearing.\\n    Mr. Largent. And do you agree 100 percent with its contents \\nprovided to this committee?\\n    Mr. Martin. I think there is some areas where clarification \\nis needed.\\n    Mr. Largent. What would those areas be and what would you \\nsay to clarify them?\\n    Mr. Martin. I believe that in the area of the Regional \\nOmbudsmen program, for example, there have been difficulties \\nwith the implementation of that program as it has been \\nestablished by the Agency. The Regional Ombudsmen do not serve \\nfull time in those capacities. Instead, it is more like 5 to 10 \\npercent of their jobs; and their regular job is to report to \\nthe people whom they would be reviewing in their particular \\nregions. That is a problem, and I think that it needs to be \\naddressed by the Agency, perhaps by Congress in its discretion.\\n    Mr. Largent. So, basically, it would be similar to, say, \\nhaving Firestone executives heading up NHTSA, overseeing the \\nproduction of tires and quality control on tires. Essentially \\nthat is what is taking place, is that right?\\n    Mr. Martin. I think there are inherent conflict of interest \\nproblems, yes.\\n    Mr. Largent. And it is my understanding that when this law \\nwas created back in 1984 that the original authorizing language \\nrequired that the Ombudsman--you were to report directly to the \\nEPA Administrator. Is that how you operate today?\\n    Mr. Martin. No, sir.\\n    Mr. Largent. Who do you report directly to?\\n    Mr. Martin. I report to Mr. Fields deputy, Mr. Shapiro, and \\nat times Mr. Fields.\\n    Mr. Largent. Why is that? Why are we not following the \\noriginal intent of the law from 1984? How did that get altered?\\n    Mr. Martin. I cannot speak for the Agency about the \\nreporting issue, but needless to say it is a decision of the \\nAgency to have the reporting structure at this time.\\n    Mr. Largent. That is the hand you were dealt?\\n    Mr. Martin. That is correct.\\n    Mr. Largent. Do you feel like it would lend to the autonomy \\nof the Ombudsman position if you reported, in fact, directly to \\nthe EPA Administrator.\\n    Mr. Martin. Yes, I do; and there is a study by the \\nAdministrative Conference of the United States which describes \\nthat as necessary.\\n    Mr. Largent. Thank you, Mr. Martin.\\n    Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Gentleman yields back.\\n    The Chair is now pleased to recognize the gentlelady from \\nIdaho who has joined our deliberations today. Welcome.\\n    Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    I wanted to follow the line of the questioning initiated by \\nMr. Largent.\\n    I find it extraordinary that EPA was created under an \\nexecutive order and yet the Congress thought so strongly about \\nan Office of the Ombudsman that under Public Law 98-616 the \\noffice was created by the Congress, and so it is of great \\nconcern to those of us Members who are involved in these issues \\nto make sure that the Ombudsman remains independent.\\n    I also find it extraordinary, Mr. Martin and Mr. Fields, \\nthat under EPA publications it is--the Office of the \\nOmbudsman--is described as a high-level employee who serves as \\na point of contact for members of the public that have concerns \\nabout Superfund activities and that the ability to look \\nindependently into problems and facilitate communication that \\ncan lead to solutions, end quote, is a responsibility of the \\nOmbudsman. I find that word ``independently'' to be very, very \\nimportant to us.\\n    In addition, Mr. Fields, in 1990 the Administrative \\nConference of the United States, of which EPA participated in, \\npublished a report that states, it is important that Ombudsmen \\nbe independent of the line offices and that they are seen as \\nindependent.\\n    Now, in your testimony you went to great lengths, Mr. \\nFields, to talk about the handbook and the standards that are \\ngoing to be published with regards to the conduct and the job \\nresponsibilities of the Ombudsman. I find that extraordinary. I \\nfind that to have EPA write rules and regulations and put forth \\nstandards for an Ombudsman whose office was created by the \\nCongress whose--it has been stated very clearly they should \\nremain independent, that is the antithesis of independence.\\n    Mr. Fields. I should clarify that the Hazardous Waste \\nOmbudsman Handbook that was written back in the late 1980's, \\n1987, was actually drafted by the first Ombudsman who was Mr. \\nMartin's predecessor. Mr. Bob Knox was instrumental in drafting \\nthat first Ombudsman's handbook.\\n    So it was not something that EPA management dictated in \\nterms of how the Ombudsman functioned or operated. It was \\nactually done by staff. And particularly the National Ombudsman \\nat the time was integrally involved in developing a Hazardous \\nWaste Ombudsman Handbook. It was felt that there needed to be \\nsome procedures and guidelines on how the function should \\noperate and how the Ombudsmen should go about doing their \\nbusiness. In the event that a subsequent Ombudsman came along \\nthat new Ombudsman would not have to start from scratch as \\nthere would be a handbook.\\n    As you know, Mr. Martin is now the second National \\nOmbudsman we have had and that handbook was at least I think \\nhelpful when Mr. Martin began his job 8 years ago.\\n    Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage. And I think that handbook clearly lays \\nout the need for independence and the concern that the Congress \\nhad when they implemented and passed and voted on Public Law \\n98-616.\\n    My concern is with the standards that you have testified to \\nthat Lois Schiffer, Assistant Attorney General here in \\nWashington, DC, had indicated that the Ombudsman's \\ninvestigative matters should not be at issue in any issue \\npending the--that has pending litigation or administrative \\nproceedings. Well, almost everything the EPA does is \\nadministrative proceedings. So knowing that Lois Schiffer has a \\nbig bark and that she has sent communications with regards to \\nthat particular issue, I am concerned that this is the kind of \\nstandard that we are going to see published and noticed in the \\nCFR.\\n    Mr. Fields. Well, Ms. Schiffer has sent communications, I \\nknow, to you, Congresswoman, about that point and also to me.\\n    As you know, we--EPA decided that we still could proceed \\nwith an Ombudsman investigation in the Coeur d'Alene basin that \\nyou and other members of the Idaho delegation requested. We \\nbelieve you can do an effective Ombudsman investigation and not \\nimpede matters involving ongoing litigation. The government \\nmust speak with one voice during litigation. As you know, as we \\nhave tried to do that.\\n    And I think we have tried to work with Mr. Martin's office \\nto make sure that he can continue to conduct an investigation \\nof the issues of concern to the public in Coeur d'Alene and not \\nadversely impede ongoing litigation. That is an issue we are \\ntrying to continue to work with.\\n    But in spite of the recommendation initially by the \\nDepartment of Justice that we not proceed with the Ombudsman \\nhearing, we agreed and I supported, as you know, the need for \\nthe Ombudsman's investigation and hearing to proceed.\\n    Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage. Thank you, Mr. Fields.\\n    I see that my time is almost up, but I do note that under \\nthe administrative regulatory news it states that the Ombudsman \\nshould facilitate communication between citizens and where \\nthere is systemic failure or systematic failure to propose more \\ngeneral reforms--I just have to say that from my own personal \\nexperience, information that we were not able to acquire, such \\nas plans to seize mines without notice to the owner, lack of \\nchain of custody with regards to how samples were drawn, that \\nis the first thing that impressed me about this Ombudsman, was \\nhis first question to me was, has there been a chain of custody \\nthat you have been able to turn up? If not, I will investigate \\nthat. That is the kind of investigation the people are crying \\nout for and I think the Congress needed when it passed public \\nlaw.\\n    Thank you.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Time of the gentleman has expired.\\n    The gentlelady from Wyoming.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    I am referring to the letter that Carol Browner sent \\nregarding the legislation that Mr. Shimkus was discussing with \\nyou on H.R. 5175. I would like to just quote one sentence from \\nit: For many years I have encouraged congressional committees \\nin both the House and the Senate to pass reasonable, targeted \\nlegislation that addresses the Superfund liability of small \\nparties. Can you be specific with me what the EPA has done, \\nwhat those exact recommendations have been, other than the \\nsubstance of the bill H.R. 5175? In other words, what didn't \\nthe Congress do that Administrator Browner wanted done?\\n    Mr. Fields. Well, the Administrator was referring to in her \\nSeptember 22 letter that over the last 7 years now we have \\nobviously implemented a set of reforms to provide liability \\nrelief for small parties----\\n    Mrs. Cubin. Name them. Name some for me, please, \\nspecifically, sir.\\n    Mr. Fields. The administrative reforms we have implemented \\nhave provided de minimus settlements to more than 21,000 \\nparties that are impacted by Superfund liability. We have \\nimplemented a program of de micromis settlements where we \\nsettled for zero dollars or one dollar for very small, tiny \\nparties at Superfund sites.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. And how many small business, third-party \\ndefendants have actually been helped by some of the things that \\nyou have done? I personally believe you would have a very, very \\ndifficult time in identifying people for me that have been \\nhelped by those things.\\n    Mr. Fields. Many of those 21,000 parties are, in fact, \\nsmall businesses. We will be happy to get back to you for the \\nrecord with an estimate of how many of those among that \\nuniverse are small businesses.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. I would appreciate that very much.\\n    Mr. Fields, you state that many people don't know how to \\nget information on solid and hazardous waste programs, or that \\nthey are frustrated by program complexities. Why have EPA \\npersonnel failed to provide easy access to this information? \\nHow many employees work in providing information to the public \\non solid and hazardous waste site s? And how many employees \\nwork in the National Ombudsman office?\\n    Mr. Fields. I don't know precisely how many people are \\nworking in EPA's enforcement program trying to identify amounts \\nof waste, I think that is what you are referring to, that have \\nbeen shipped to Superfund sites. There are hundreds of them, I \\nknow, across the country. The old records are difficult to \\nfind. It is a hard task, doing the searches necessary to \\ndocument those waste amounts. But I would provide for the \\nrecord to the subcommittees precisely how many of our \\nenforcement personnel are involved in doing those tasks.\\n    [The following was received for the record:]\\n\\n    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes the \\nneed for people living near Superfund sites to be well-informed \\nand involved in decisions concerning sites in their \\ncommunities. Through years of implementation of the program, \\nEPA has determined that early and meaningful community \\ninvolvement in the cleanup decisions is important in order to \\nhave a successful Superfund site cleanup. On-Scene \\nCoordinators, Remedial Project Managers and Community \\nInvolvement Coordinators work with community members to ensure \\nthey understand what Superfund activities being conducted at a \\nsite and how the community can participate in the process. Each \\nyear, EPA staff members conduct hundreds of public meetings and \\ndoor-to-door visits, and distribute thousands of fact sheets to \\ncommunities. Many times EPA establishes a satellite office near \\na Superfund site to ensure community members have easy access \\nto Regional staff.\\n    EPA also provides communities with technical assistance so \\nthat they are better able to meaningfully participate in \\ncleanup decisions. The cornerstone of EPA's efforts is the \\nTechnical Assistance Grant (TAG) program. Under the TAG \\nprogram, community organizations can apply for an initial grant \\nof up to $50,000 to hire their own independent technical \\nadvisors. In FY2000, seven new TAGs were awarded, and \\napproximately $1.25 million was given out for these new awards \\nand for amendments to existing TAGs.\\n    A corollary to the TAG program is the Technical Outreach \\nServices for Communities (TOSC) program. Through TOSC, EPA \\nfunds the Hazardous Substance Research Centers to provide \\nindependent technical assistance for communities. In FY 2000, \\nthe TOSC program was funded at $1.300 million. TOSC was active \\nat 118 sites in FY 2000.\\n    EPA's Community Advisory Group (CAG) program seeks to bring \\ntogether early in the process a broad group of stakeholders who \\nare interested in the work going on at the site in their \\ncommunity. Started in June 1993, the CAG program is designed to \\nenhance community involvement in the Superfund process. A CAG \\nis designed to serve as the focal point for the exchange of \\ninformation among the local community and EPA, the State \\nregulatory agency, and other pertinent Federal agencies \\ninvolved in cleanup of the Superfund site.\\n    Additional components of EPA's Superfund community \\ninvolvement program include translations of public documents, \\nand access to neutral facilitators. Some of the Superfund sites \\nhave non-English speaking populations surrounding them. In \\nthese cases, EPA translates public information documents into \\nthe languages of the people living near the site and provides \\ninterpreters at public meetings. EPA also provides community \\nmembers with access to neutral conveners, facilitators, and \\nmediators.\\n    In addition to the National Ombudsman, two full-time EPA \\nemployees, Senior Environmental Employee grantees and a number \\nof student interns are assigned to assist the National \\nOmbudsman. Also, the National Ombudsman has access to sources \\noutside of EPA if additional assistance is needed to help him \\nconduct an investigation. The Ombudsman function, depending on \\nthe sites and issues under its review during any one time, \\ndraws upon the existing technical resources of the Office of \\nSolid Waste and Emergency Response, and particularly that of \\nthe Environmental Response Team, to supplement its \\ninvestigative efforts. Each Regional Office has designated a \\nRegional Superfund Ombudsmen as well.\\n\\n    Mr. Fields. In terms of the people involved in the National \\nOmbudsman's program across the country, I will defer to Mr. \\nMartin for more details on his immediate staff.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. If you could just submit that for me.\\n    [The following was received for the record:]\\n\\n    The Office of Ombudsman was abolished by Acting Assistant \\nAdministrator Tim Fields on October 31, 1997, one week after my \\nreceipt of a subpoena to appear in my official capacity before \\na Federal criminal grand Jury on the Times Beach Ombudsman \\ncase. There has been no Office of Ombudsman, therefore, since \\nOctober 31, 1997 (See, Attachment 2). During my entire tenure \\nas Ombudsman, I have been and continue to be the only permanent \\nEPA employee assigned to the National Ombudsman function.\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.058\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.059\\n\\n    Mr. Fields. I know there are 10 people in the regions who \\nare spending some of their time on this function as well.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. I think the question that I cared the most \\nabout is why the EPA has failed to provide easy access to this \\ninformation, as you stated yourself.\\n    Mr. Fields. Well, it is not easy information to get access \\nto. Oftentimes, the records are not adequate to document how \\nmuch waste has been shipped.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. When you say it is true that folks are being \\nrequested to give the information, they don't know what they \\nare supposed to give.\\n    Mr. Fields. Well, maybe we could provide--as you were \\nindicating, maybe we could provide better guidance or clarity \\nproviding the precise types of information people ought to be \\nsubmitting. That is probably something we can work on.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. The subcommittee asked you to provide funding \\nfigures for the Ombudsman office for the current year and for \\nthe previous 5 years. I wonder why you didn't provide this \\nspecific information but instead you chose to only provide \\nfiscal year 1993 and 2000 information. Why is that?\\n    Mr. Fields. I just did that just to summarize for the \\nrecord. I have actually provided for this committee--I have \\nwith me today precise documentation that goes back for 10 years \\nindicating the dollar figures for the Ombudsman's Office. It \\nwas roughly $230,000 in 1998, $360,000 in 1999, $519,000 in \\n2000. I have numbers going back to 1990. I think it was like \\n$117,000 in 1990. So I will provide for the record this piece \\nof paper that documents from 1991 through 2000 the precise \\namounts that have been allocated for the Ombudsman function.\\n    [The following was received for the record:]\\n\\n    Below is the annual budget for the National Ombudsman for \\nthe past ten years:\\n\\nFY91.......................................................  $116,000.00\\nFY92.......................................................  $113,000.00\\nFY93.......................................................  $117,000.00\\nFY94.......................................................  $136,000.00\\nFY95.......................................................  $142,000.00\\nFY96.......................................................  $158,000.00\\nFY97.......................................................  $157,000.00\\nFY98.......................................................  $262,000.00\\nFY99.......................................................  $345,000.00\\nFY00.......................................................  $519,000.00\\n \\n\\n    Also, the National Ombudsman function, depending on the \\nsites and issues under its review during any one time, draws \\nupon the existing technical resources of the Office of Solid \\nWaste and Emergency Response (OSWER), and particularly that of \\nthe Environmental Response Team, to supplement its \\ninvestigative efforts.\\n    There are Regional Superfund Ombudsmen in each Regional \\nOffice, as well. These functions are funded at a total of \\nroughly $1 million a year.\\n\\n    Mrs. Cubin. Okay. Two things--I am not sure that just those \\nsingle figures will be adequate. Will you be willing to provide \\nfurther accounting to the committee if so requested?\\n    Mr. Fields. Sure.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. Then, last, do you believe that the office is \\nbeing funded adequately at the levels that you----\\n    Mr. Fields. The Ombudsman function has been funded now at \\nroughly $500,000 to $600,000 this year. I think, you know, and \\nI will--we have got to make sure we provide the resources that \\nMr. Martin needs to do his functions.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. Do you think it is adequate?\\n    Mr. Fields. I think the budget of what we provided this \\nyear, of 500,000 to $600,000, is an adequate amount.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. Mr. Martin, do you think it is adequate?\\n    Mr. Martin. I want to clarify a question you had posed \\nearlier about the number of people who work in my office. It is \\nme--and Mr. Kaufman has been assigned at least half time to the \\noffice. I also have three interns whose term will be expiring \\nnear the end of this year who have been with me since the \\nbeginning of the summer. So this is the staffing. Given where \\nthe case load is going, it is extremely large, I think more \\nresources will be needed.\\n    Mrs. Cubin. Doesn't seem like much of a commitment to me on \\nthe part of the EPA to actually try to work with constituents \\nwith one person across the United States officially working on \\ntheir behalf to try to settle discrepancies between the Agency \\nand citizens.\\n    But thank you very much. My time has expired.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Would the gentlelady yield?\\n    Mrs. Cubin. Certainly.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. I would agree with you. It certainly doesn't \\nseem to be consistent with the mission statement EPA has \\nregarding cleanup of these Superfund sites.\\n    Mr. Fields, just very quickly, discussion took place \\nregarding the Miranda warning and the instructions that were \\nfurnished to the Ombudsman's Office on the part of the \\nInspector General. We have a September 12 letter from Mark \\nBialek, Counsel to Inspector General. Is that the letter to \\nwhich you referred?\\n    Mr. Fields. That was the letter I was referring to.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Is there another letter?\\n    Mr. Fields. I said there was a response from Mr. Kaufman. I \\nthink we agreed we would provide that for the record as well.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. That was a response from Mr. Kaufman to Mr. \\nBialek.\\n    Mr. Fields. Yes.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Any further communications from Mr. Bialek \\nin response to Mr. Kaufman?\\n    Mr. Fields. I am not aware of any further communications. I \\nsaw this letter, and then there was another letter from Mr. \\nKaufman on this matter. I am not aware of any other \\ncommunications on this.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Well, the letter from Mr. Kaufman you are \\nproviding for the record.\\n    Mr. Fields. I don't have a copy of that with me today, but \\nwe did agreed to provide it.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Without objection, will the----\\n    Mr. Oxley. Without objection.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Without objection, that will be the case.\\n    All right, thank you very much.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Gentlelady from Idaho.\\n    Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage. Mr. Chairman, I just did some quick \\nmath. Considering the fact that this Ombudsman has 14 major \\ncases going on around the Nation, he is spending, on an \\naverage, about $36,000 per case; and that includes travel, \\neverything. It is--I think $500,000 is not much of a commitment \\nto justice and truth.\\n    Thank you very much.\\n    Mr. Fields. Mr. Chairman, may I just add to that comment?\\n    I want to point out there are 10 other Regional Ombudsmen \\nthat we are funding for about a million dollars across the \\ncountry in addition to the $500,000 that I talked about for \\n2000. We have also supplemented Mr. Martin's support with \\nsupport for the environmental response team at Edison, New \\nJersey, other EPA staff that also provide support. So it is not \\njust that amount. There are other people across the country and \\nin headquarters who are providing support over and above that \\n$519,000 amount.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Mr. Chairman, if I could add my two cents.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Very briefly, gentlelady from Colorado.\\n    Ms. DeGette. I agree with my colleague to the north, Mrs. \\nCubin.\\n    I would chime in, also, that with the increased caseload of \\nthe Ombudsman and with the burdens that we are putting on him \\nat not just a regional level but also a national level and with \\nthe new rules and requirements that you are in the process of \\npromulgating it would seem to me that the Agency would want the \\nmake a commitment at the national level to have assistance for \\nthe Ombudsman and professional, paid, full-time staff that \\ncould assist in these investigations.\\n    I would echo, my view, too, if we are going in the \\ndirection of involvement in more cases for the Ombudsman, to be \\neffective and responsible I think he is going to need to have \\nadequate resources.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Gentlelady's time has expired.\\n    Let the Chair, in closing, do two or three housekeeping--\\nthe Chair would like to enter into the record a copy of the \\ntransmission report. This was the transmission of the \\ninvitation to appear at the hearing today to Mr. Martin, care \\nof Randy Deitz. Mr. Martin, is that Randy Deits?\\n    Mr. Fields. Randy Deitz is the gentleman behind me here.\\n    Mr. Oxley. He work for you, Mr. Fields?\\n    Mr. Fields. Mr. Deitz works in the Office of Congressional \\nand Government Relations at EPA.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Okay. This is a copy of the hearing invitation \\nletter. Just for the record, the document was confirmed and \\nsent on 9/27 at 4:35 p.m. That was Wednesday afternoon, just \\nfor the record.\\n    [The material follows:]\\n\\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.060\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.061\\n    \\n    Mr. Oxley. Mr. Fields, as you know, my colleague Helen \\nChenoweth-Hage has been closely following EPA Superfund- \\nrelated activities in northern Idaho. One of her concerns is \\nthe EPA's plans for the new Bunker Hill Mine in Kellogg, Idaho. \\nCongresswoman Chenoweth-Hage is not satisfied that she has \\nreceived all of the EPA documents relevant to this site. I am \\ngoing to submit several requests for information to you on her \\nbehalf. Can I have your assurance that you will respond to the \\nrequest in a timely manner sought by my colleague from Idaho?\\n    Mr. Fields. I will do so, sir.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Thank you.\\n    Finally, Mr. Fields, in the discussion about the funding \\nfor ombudsmen and the like, you had indicated you had all the \\nfunding records with you.\\n    Mr. Fields. Yes, and our Congressional Affairs Office will \\nmake sure your staff are given those documents.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Can we have those submitted for the record?\\n    Mr. Fields. Sure.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Thank you.\\n    [The following was received for the record:]\\n\\n    Below is the annual budget for the National Ombudsman for \\nthe past ten years:\\n\\nFY91....................................................     $116,000.00\\nFY92....................................................     $113,000.00\\nFY93....................................................     $117,000.00\\nFY94....................................................     $136,000.00\\nFY95....................................................     $142,000.00\\nFY96....................................................     $158,000.00\\nFY97....................................................     $157,000.00\\nFY98....................................................     $262,000.00\\nFY99....................................................     $345,000.00\\nFY00....................................................     $519,000.00\\n \\n\\n    Also, the National Ombudsman function, depending on the \\nsites and issues under its review during any one time, draws \\nupon the existing technical resources of the Office of Solid \\nWaste and Emergency Response (OSWER), and particularly that of \\nthe Environmental Response Team, to supplement its \\ninvestigative efforts.\\n    There are Regional Superfund Ombudsmen in each Regional \\nOffice, as well. These functions are funded at a total of \\nroughly $1 million a year.\\n\\n    Mr. Oxley. The gentleman from Illinois.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Thank you.\\n    I know we are trying to move forward, but I do want to ask \\nMr. Martin--and I appreciate--I really do appreciate you being \\nhere and the challenges, based upon current law, reading some \\nof the descriptions, I am not sure how--I think it is a very \\ntough job that you have. I would like, if you would then, to \\nfollow up with legislation to answer a question on whether the \\nOmbudsman should be reauthorized. And if the answer is yes, \\nwhat would be your suggestions of how it would change?\\n    Now being an Ombudsman and being part of the EPA, I don't \\nknow how you effectively do that without allowing the EPA's \\nhand to get involved in the recommendation. I have I think a \\ngood sense that you want to, you know, continue a role for the \\nOmbudsman, and I think you probably had some ideas of how we \\ncan improve it.\\n    And, Mr. Fields, I would respectfully ask that you allow \\nhim to submit those recommendations to us unedited so that we \\ncan look at the reauthorization and look at ways that we can \\nimprove it.\\n    Mr. Fields. I have no problem with that at all.\\n    [The following was received for the record:]\\n\\n    The Hazardous Waste and Superfund Ombudsman Office should be \\nreconstituted and reauthorized consistent with H.R. 3656 for a period \\nof ten (10) years. Moreover, the legislation to reauthorize the Office \\nof Ombudsman should include, at a minimum:\\n\\n* Re-establishment of the Office of Ombudsman;\\n* Allocation of resources under the control of the Office and as \\n        defined by the Office, to implement the function;\\n Authorization to perform duties consistent with the IRS Ombudsman \\n        function, already established by Congress.\\n\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Based upon the terminology or the language, \\nthe Ombudsman shall not affect any procedures or grievances, \\nappeals or administrative matters which comes out of the \\ncurrent law, and I didn't get a chance to ask about your \\ninvolvement with small businesses and individual aspects. It \\nseems like the overall issue and the overall fight--but I think \\nthere seems to be--we need to develop some more independence \\nand we need I think to broaden the scope a little bit.\\n    Because a lot of us, we are Members, we are ombudsmen; and \\nthat is why we get so fired up about this. So I think there is \\na lot of sympathy for the battles that you have to fight, and I \\njust appreciate you being here. It is usually not an enjoyable \\nexperience sometimes, but it is healthy as we move forward on \\nlegislation.\\n    So if you would provide that--Mr. Fields, if you would \\nallow that to occur, I would appreciate that.\\n    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.\\n    Mr. Oxley. The gentleman may respond very briefly.\\n    Mr. Fields. We will definitely adhere to the Congressman's \\nrequest in terms of Mr. Martin's providing his suggestions to \\nthe subcommittees on the views on how the Ombudsman operation \\nshould operate.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Gentlemen, thank you for your testimony. \\nAppreciate it.\\n    We will now turn over the Chair to the co-chairman, Mr. \\nBilirakis.\\n    Mr. Sawyer. Mr. Chairman, just before, let me say thank you \\nfor the opportunity to participate in this way and thank you to \\nboth of our witnesses for their responses.\\n    Mr. Oxley. Next session you may want to join the \\nsubcommittee.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis [presiding]. I would ask, as I move over to \\nthe main chair, that a representative of the administration \\nstay in the room to hear the testimony, particularly in this \\ncase, of the citizens' panel. So, Mr. Fields, it would be great \\nif you can stay, but if you can't, we understand. But \\nhopefully, you will have someone here to take notes and all \\nthat. Because we are all working for the same people, that is \\nthe taxpayers; and we should all be greatly concerned.\\n    Mr. Fields. I agree. I, unfortunately, cannot. I have to go \\nto a meeting with our Administrator. But I will assure you we \\nwill have staff here to be available.\\n    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Next panel, Mr. Bret Bowers, Executive \\nDirector of Community Leaders for EPA Accountability Now! from \\nCoeur d'Alene, Idaho; Ms. Mary Mosley, former city commissioner \\nand civic activist from Tarpon Springs, Florida; and Ms. \\nKimberly Boggiatto from Denver, Colorado.\\n    I would hope as we go into your testimony that you will \\ncomplement or supplement your written statement in your 5 \\nminutes. Your entire written testimony, by the way, is part of \\nthe record.\\n    We do have legislation to reauthorize the Office of the \\nOmbudsman which would provide specifics in terms of its \\nfunctions and an increase in funding, and I would hope that we \\ncan get the support of all the members of the subcommittee.\\n    Having said all that, in view of the way you have lined up \\nthere, we will start off with Ms. Boggiatto. Please proceed, \\nma'am.\\n\\n    STATEMENTS OF KIMBERLY BOGGIATTO; MARY MOSLEY; AND BRET \\n     BOWERS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COMMUNITY LEADERS FOR EPA \\n                      ACCOUNTABILITY NOW!\\n\\n    Ms. Boggiatto. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of \\nthe subcommittees. I am extremely honored by your invitation to \\ntestify before you today with respect to the role of the EPA \\nNational Ombudsman in addressing concerns of local communities.\\n    I would also like to thank Congresswoman DeGette and her \\nstaff for her hospitality over the past couple of days.\\n    I today am representing Clean-It!, which is our local \\ncitizens' group that was formed for the sole purpose of \\nadvocating for the removal of the radioactive and toxic waste \\nat the Shattuck Superfund site in south Denver. And \\nCongresswoman DeGette's office was nice enough to provide us \\nwith the beautiful picture over there of our very own \\nradioactive waste dump.\\n    Clean-It! stands for Citizens Loving Our Environment and \\nNeighborhood--Invincible Together, and not only does it make a \\ngreat acronym but I think it is pretty accurate as far as what \\nwe have been able to accomplish.\\n    The Shattuck site is contaminated by radioactive and toxic \\nwastes from a decade of radium processing. The contamination \\nfound at the Shattuck site is not unique in Denver. There were \\napproximately 10 other Superfund sites with similar \\ncontamination. What makes Shattuck unique is that it is the \\nonly one of these sites where the EPA decided that the \\nappropriate remedy was onsite disposal. EPA decided for all of \\nthe other sites that removal of the radioactive soils should be \\nto a licensed, low-level radioactive waste disposal facility \\nand that that was the only remedy that was--both satisfied \\nexisting laws and regulation and was protective of human health \\nand the environment. In fact, EPA originally determined that \\nthe wastes at the Shattuck site should also be removed and then \\nwent to public comment with that preferred alternative back in \\nthe early 1990's.\\n    However, after closing the public comment period, EPA \\ndecided, apparently, to reverse its decision and subsequently \\nissued a decision that ordered the radioactive materials left \\non the site.\\n    The Ombudsman's investigation was critical in discovering \\nsort of behind-closed-doors meetings that EPA Region 8 held \\nwith the owner of the site, and these meetings appeared to have \\nfactored into EPA's reversal of their original recommendation.\\n    In early 1999, the National Ombudsman Bob Martin and \\nInvestigator Hugh Kaufman came to Denver to listen to the \\ncitizens' concerns regarding Shattuck. Mr. Martin and Mr. \\nKaufman were the first EPA officials who actually listened. \\nThey treated the citizens with respect and with dignity, and \\nthat was in sharp contrast to how the citizens had been treated \\nby Region 8 officials over the previous decade.\\n    Also, in the spring of 1999, EPA Assistant Administrator \\nTimothy Fields began to look into EPA Region 8's management of \\nthe Shattuck site. Assistant Administrator Fields initiated a \\nmediated stakeholder process that lasted roughly 6 months and \\nincluded a thorough technical review of the existing remedy. I \\nbelieve that the Ombudsman's investigation swayed EPA \\nheadquarters to focus attention and resources on Shattuck.\\n    The Ombudsman's investigation was essential in exposing \\nimproperly withheld documents, which I hear is a theme at many \\nof these other sites, as well as concerns about the kinds of \\nwaste that might be disposed of at the Shattuck site. And we \\nhave heard some talk from Congresswoman DeGette today about the \\npotential defense waste and other such things.\\n    In short, the Ombudsman's investigation of EPA Region 8's \\nmismanagement of Shattuck was instrumental in the recent \\ndecision that Shattuck wastes must be removed from the site. \\nThe citizens knew that if an honest review were conducted the \\nwastes would have to be removed. Bob Martin and his staff were \\nthe only EPA officials truly willing to look at the abuse of \\npower by and gross incompetence of EPA Region 8 officials and \\nstaff. I believe that this abuse of power and incompetence not \\nonly extends up to Regional Administrator Bill Yellowtail but \\nalso emanates from him.\\n    My experience working with the Ombudsman's Office has \\nbought to my attention some changes that would improve the \\noperation of the office. The improvements essentially fall \\nwithin two categories: resources and independence.\\n    It is clear from my experience that additional staff would \\nbe very useful for the Ombudsman's Office. This would allow for \\nmore thorough reviews and investigations as well as the ability \\nto accept more cases. The office also needs a larger budget not \\nonly to fund the additional staff but also to hire experts and \\npay for independent laboratory analyses where appropriate.\\n    Perhaps even more important is the issue of independence. \\nIt is imperative that the Ombudsman has the final decision as \\nto which cases are investigated and how the office's budget is \\nallocated. It is my impression that EPA too often attempts to \\nexert influence over the cases that are accepted for review and \\nthe extent to which a case is investigated by constraining the \\nactivities that will be funded. Imagine if EPA could determine \\nthese subcommittees budgets so as to dictate which oversight \\nhearings could be held or which bills could be considered. Such \\na situation would clearly hinder your ability to oversee the \\nEPA and result in an enormous disservice to the citizens of \\nthis Nation.\\n    Just this kind of disservice results when the Ombudsman's \\nbudget is manipulated so as to impede his investigations. The \\nOmbudsman and his staff are uniquely prepared to review and \\ninvestigate EPA's actions because of their extensive knowledge \\nand applicable statutes and regulations as well as their broad \\ntechnical and scientific knowledge. Because the Ombudsman's \\nOffice accepts cases at the request of elected officials, it \\nfunctions to support and enhance your ability to scrutinize the \\nactions and decisions of the EPA.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Please summarize, if you could, Ms. \\nBoggiatto.\\n    Ms. Boggiatto. Certainly. I would just like to add, there \\nare guidelines out there that have been discussed of those of \\nthe EPA as well as some guidelines that appear to be relevant \\nthat were published in 1990 in the Federal Register on the role \\nof the Ombudsman within Federal agencies that uphold the \\nindependence and integrity of this office. I do not believe \\nthat EPA administration is the appropriate place for the \\nguidelines to be developed and that that would serve generally \\nto diminish independence and compromise the integrity of the \\nOmbudsman's Office.\\n    Essentially, the argument for a strong EPA Ombudsman comes \\ndown to simple human nature: The best incentive for being \\nhonest is knowing you would be caught if you weren't. That is \\nhow I see the role of the Ombudsman, essentially, is that the \\nfurther resources you give the Ombudsman's Office the more the \\nEPA will realize that they have to make good decisions and they \\nhave to be accountable to the people. Because if they are not, \\nwe have an active and aggressive Ombudsman's Office who will \\nexpose the injustices, and I think that will serve to really \\nreform the Agency and stop many of the situations we all have \\nexperienced.\\n    [The prepared statement of Kimberly Boggiatto follows:]\",\n",
       " 'Prepared statement of kimberly boggiatto': \"Good morning Mr. Chairmen and members of the subcommittees. I am \\nextremely honored by your invitation to testify before you today with \\nrespect to the role of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \\nNational Ombudsman in addressing concerns of local communities. My name \\nis Kimberly Boggiatto and I am representing Clean-It! Clean-It! stands \\nfor Citizens loving our environment and neighborhood--Invincible \\ntogether! We are a local citizens' group that formed to advocate for \\nthe removal of the radioactive and toxic waste from the Shattuck \\nSuperfund site in south Denver.\\n    The Shattuck site is contaminated by radioactive and toxic wastes \\nfrom decades of radium processing. The contamination found at the \\nShattuck site is not unique in Denver; there were approximately ten \\nother superfund sites with similar contamination. What makes Shattuck \\nunique is that it is the only one of these sites where the EPA decided \\nthat the appropriate remedy was onsite disposal. EPA decided for all of \\nthe other sites that removal of the radioactive soils to a licensed, \\nlow-level radioactive waste disposal facility was the only remedy that \\nboth satisfied existing laws and regulations and was protective of \\nhuman health and the environment. In fact, EPA originally determined \\nthat the wastes should be removed from the Shattuck site as well. \\nHowever, after closing the public comment period in which strong \\nsupport for removal was expressed, EPA issued a decision that ordered \\nthe radioactive soil disposed of on site. The Ombudsman's investigation \\nwas critical in discovering the ``behind closed doors'' meetings that \\nEPA Region VII held with the owner of the site which appear to have \\nfactored into EPA's final decision to bury radioactive waste only a \\nblock from residences, within the densely populated City of Denver.\\n    In early 1999, the National Ombudsman, Bob Martin, and Investigator \\nHugh Kaufman, came to Denver to listen to the citizens' concerns \\nregarding Shattuck. Mr. Martin and Mr. Kaufman were the first EPA \\nofficials who actually listened to the concerns of our community. They \\ntreated the citizens with respect and dignity, in contrast to the \\nnumerous EPA Region VIII officials and staff over the previous decade. \\nAlso in the spring of 1999, EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office \\nof Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER), Timothy Fields, began to \\nlook into EPA Region VIII's management of the Shattuck site. Assistant \\nAdministrator Fields initiated a mediated stakeholder process that \\nlasted roughly six months and included a technical review of the \\nexisting remedy.

In short, the Ombudsman's \\ninvestigation of EPA Region VIII's mismanagement of Shattuck was \\ninstrumental in the recent decision that the Shattuck wastes must be \\nremoved from the site. The citizens knew that if an honest review were \\nconducted, the wastes would have to be removed. Bob Martin and his \\nstaff were the only EPA officials truly willing to look at the abuse of \\npower by and gross incompetence of EPA Region VIII officials and staff. \\nI believe that this abuse of power and incompetence not only extends up \\nto Regional Administrator Bill Yellowtail, but also emanates from him.\\n    My experience working with the Ombudsman's Office has brought to my \\nattention some changes that would improve the operation of the Office. \\nThe improvements essentially fall into two categories: resources and \\nindependence.\\n    It was clear from my experience that the Ombudsman's Office would \\nbe well served by additional investigators.

The Office also needs a larger budget not \\nonly to fund the additional staff, but also to hire experts and pay for \\nindependent laboratory analyses as appropriate.\\n    Perhaps even more important is the issue of independence. It is \\nimperative that the Ombudsman has the final decision as to which cases \\nare investigated and how the Office's budget is allocated. It is my \\nimpression that EPA too often attempts to exert influence over the \\ncases that are accepted for review and the extent to which a case is \\ninvestigated by constraining the activities that will be funded. \\nImagine if EPA could determine the subcommittees' budgets so as to \\ndictate which oversight hearings could be held or which bills could be \\nconsidered. Such a situation would clearly hinder your ability to \\noversee the EPA and result in an enormous disservice to the citizens of \\nthis nation.\\n    Just this kind of disservice results when the Ombudsman's budget is \\nmanipulated so as to impede his investigations. The Ombudsman and his \\nstaff are uniquely prepared to review and investigate EPA's actions \\nbecause of their extensive knowledge of the applicable statutes and \\nregulations as well as their broad technical and scientific knowledge. \\nBecause the Ombudsman's Office accepts cases at the request of elected \\nofficials, it functions to support and enhance your ability to \\nscrutinize the actions and decisions of the EPA.\\n    Fortunately, there are guidelines that describe the proper role and \\noperation of the Ombudsman. The American Bar Association has \\nestablished guidelines that appear to be well suited to the EPA \\nNational Ombudsman. These guidelines would provide for the independence \\nand integrity necessary for a constructive Ombudsman's Office. Also, in \\n1990 recommendations regarding the role of Ombudsmen within federal \\nagencies were published in the Federal Register. These guidelines also \\nappear to uphold the independence and integrity of the Ombudsman. Given \\nthat independent and appropriate guidelines already exist, EPA should \\nnot attempt to create its own set of guidelines for the operation of \\nthe Ombudsman's Office. Internal guidelines would inevitably diminish \\nindependence and compromise the integrity of the Ombudsman when just \\nthe opposite result is needed.\\n    The argument for a strong EPA Ombudsman comes down to simple human \\nnature: The best incentive for being honest, is knowing you would be \\ncaught if you weren't. This tenet conveys the vital role that the \\nOmbudsman's Office plays within EPA. In order to continue in that role, \\nthe Ombudsman's Office needs support from Congress both in terms of a \\nsecure source of funding and a clear statutory mandate of independence.\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today. I \\nam happy to answer any questions that you may have.\\n\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you very much. Very well put.\\n    Ms. Mosley, you are on.

I want to thank the distinguished members of \\nthe two subcommittees for the opportunity to speak regarding \\nthe role of the Ombudsman's Office.\\n    I have been involved in the Stauffer Superfund site in \\nTarpon Springs, Florida, for nearly 25 years. During that time, \\nI learned that Environmental Protection Agency Region 4 is an \\nagency out of control and conducts their duties as though their \\nallegiance is to the polluter rather than to the Superfund \\ncommunities they are mandated to protect.

At one hearing, in \\nresponse to Congressman Bilirakis's polite request to remain \\nmore than 10 minutes to answer the community's questions, EPA \\nadamantly refused and flounced out of the meeting. The \\ncommunity was outraged that the EPA would treat an elected \\nofficial acting on our behalf in such a manner.\\n    The EPA chose a monolith as a remedy for our Superfund site \\nwhich would cover 25 to 35 acres without having first conducted \\nsufficient testing to determine if the site could ever support \\na mound of such magnitude. The site, which contains wastes such \\nas asbestos, arsenic, radium 226 and more, already has \\nsinkholes, is surrounded by sinkholes and is, coincidentally, \\nlocated directly above two aquifers, one of which serves as the \\nmain drinking water source for a large portion of the State. \\nShould the proposed monolith fail, it would be disastrous to \\nimportant water supplies.\\n    I might add there have been experts that have attended \\nmeetings that said that the monolith will not be successful, \\nthat the sinkholes have already opened communication between \\nthe two aquifers.\\n    Robert Martin and his chief investigator Hugh Kaufman \\nexposed the flaws of the monolith at Shattuck in Denver. After \\nthe investigation by the Ombudsman's Office, the EPA reversed \\nitself and admitted that the only way to ensure the public \\nhealth and welfare was for Shattuck's wastes to be hauled to a \\nrepository.\\n    The elected officials of Tarpon Springs also feel that the \\nremoval of waste is the only safe solution for our community, \\nbut the wastes at our Superfund site are so toxic that they \\nwould have to be treated before a nuclear dump would accept it.\\n    In conclusion, the EPA has worked for 6 years with \\ninsufficient investigations. They now admit to having data \\ngaps. The EPA has neglected, to date, to adequately define the \\nmagnitude and extent of groundwater contamination originating \\nfrom the site. Despite having a poor record of scientific \\napproach, the EPA continues to decrease the number of \\ncontaminants of concern. There are other problems too numerous \\nto mention in the brief time allotted today.\\n    To counter the failure of the EPA to responsibly administer \\nthe Superfund Act, the Ombudsman's Office must be well funded \\nand independent of any attempts that might be made to silence \\nthe voice of truth.

It doesn't sit well, knowing that National \\nGeographic magazine has named our lake one of the five most \\nbeautiful lakes in the world, and today the Idaho Department of \\nEnvironmental Quality calls lake Coeur d'Alene a world-class \\nlake.\\n    C.L.E.A.N. organized with support of community and business \\nleaders, the Chamber of Commerce, realtors, citizens and \\nelected officials--including county commissioners, city \\ncouncilmen, mayors and State legislators. We committed \\nourselves to understand the EPA's processes, recognizing the \\nhistory that already exists with Superfund in neighboring \\nShoshone County, home of the Bunker Hill Superfund site and \\nupstream of Lake Coeur d'Alene.\\n    The problem that has brought me to here today took 100 \\nyears to create, 14 hours to explain during our Ombudsman \\nhearing, and I have 5 minutes.\\n    EPA and the Department of Justice actions threaten not only \\nour economic stability but also our environment and the way \\nothers around the region and the world look at our region.\\n    The EPA would like the Ombudsman and all of us to believe \\nthe Bunker Hill was never limited to the 21 square mile \\nboundary the EPA helped create on the National Priorities List \\nin 1983. After 17 years, $200 million has been spent in the \\nbox. The EPA now wants to start completely over and expand the \\nsite into a 1,500 square mile region, creating the Nation's \\nlargest Superfund site. Just when many of us thought the end \\nwas near, the EPA wants to start over by changing the rules.\\n    Therefore, any legislation to reauthorize the Ombudsman is \\ngood news to us. But, sir, we need more than an internal EPA \\ninvestigation on this. We welcome the Federal Government's \\nhelp, not its heavy hand.\\n    Until the Ombudsman hearing, our local elected leaders \\nbelieved the only way they had their voices heard and concerns \\nheard was to pay for the opportunity through friends of the \\ncourt amicus briefs in litigation at the U.S. District and \\nappellate court levels.\\n    We recognize the need for cleanup. So do the mines. They \\nhave offered $250 million to settle a lawsuit and begin \\ncleanup.\\n    Many of us are working in cooperation with the State to \\nfinalize a plan that prioritizes cleanup and develops \\nlegislation for Federal funding that you will have the \\nopportunity to vote on next year. But questions have been \\nraised dealing with not just the environment, but human health.\\n    How can the EPA discount the scientific, site-specific \\nevidence showing children living in the Bunker Hill site have a \\nmuch lower accumulation of blood lead than EPA's national \\ndefault models show? Why won't the EPA consider lead-based \\npaint as a potential source of exposure when the majority of \\nhomes in the Silver Valley were built before the 1970's?\\n    Today, inside the Bunker Hill site, 94 percent of the \\nchildren are within the EPA's remedial action goal. On average, \\ncommunities inside the Bunker Hill site have been under the \\nCenters for Disease Control's standard since 1990.\\n    On the environmental side, the discharge from the operating \\nmines today account for less than 1 percent of the metal \\nfloating in the river system. But after $200 million have been \\nspent in the box, we now know that EPA's central impoundment \\narea has become the largest source of metals into the south \\nfork of the Coeur d'Alene River.\\n    Why should EPA be allowed to mandate a water quality \\nstandard State and industry must meet but the EPA cannot \\nachieve itself at the Bunker Hill site?\\n    Outside the box, science tells us the largest loader of \\nlead into our watershed is the result of erosion from the river \\nbanks. So why did EPA stall and then reduce in size a \\nstabilization project to the point there may not be any \\ntangible results?\\n    We are concerned because the threat of basin-wide Superfund \\ncould have devastating economic ripples throughout the inland \\nNorthwest.\\n    Here are the facts for Shoshone County where hard-working \\nfamilies want to turn around the stigma Superfund has placed on \\nthem for the last 20 years. What used to be the world's largest \\nlead, silver and zinc mining district with 90 operating mines \\nis now down to just three; 7,500 miners are down to 800. In \\nfact, it is the only county in Idaho with a population \\ndecrease, one of only four nationwide. Shoshone County has had \\nthe State's highest unemployment rate and highest child poverty \\nrate and has seen its assessed value drop from $1.3 billion to \\nless than $500 million.\\n    Those facts have caught the attention of all of us, trying \\nto overcome the onslaught of environmental regulations that \\nhave but all shut down our region's natural resource \\nindustries.\\n    EPA believes they can expand the site even though Lake \\nCoeur d'Alene meets Federal drinking water standards. EPA has \\nstudied and found our beaches are safe. We can swim and play in \\nthe lake all we want, and the Centers for Disease Control's \\nATSDR has determined our fish in the lake and in the river and \\nthe lateral lakes and the flood plain are safe to eat.\\n    So why do Federal plans for cleanup call for dredging our \\nriver and the lake with a $3.8 billion price tag that will \\nbankrupt not only businesses and communities but it will ruin \\nwater quality for decades to come? Why should the EPA be \\nallowed to characterize our beautiful region in a negative \\nlight as they have done repeatedly in national publications?\\n    The Ombudsman investigation put a spotlight on EPA's \\nposition onsite boundaries. EPA's view gives them an open-ended \\ntime line at further expense to our communities, our private \\nproperty rights and our environment.\\n    So it all boils down to trust. How can we trust the EPA \\nwhen in 1991 Region 10 Administrator Dana Rasmussen wrote to \\nCongressman Larry Larocco with, quote, let me state \\nunequivocally, it is not EPA's intention to expand the \\nboundaries of the site. We recognize that there are many other \\nregulatory tools besides Superfund legislation to affect \\nenvironmental improvements.\\n    Yet, now we're facing major expansion.\\n    Mr. Chairman, I will summarize in closing.\\n    How can we trust the Department of Justice when they are \\nthe driving force behind the lawsuit and tried to prevent the \\nOmbudsman from taking part in our recent hearing? We shouldn't \\nbe forced to spend the next 30 years paying off a debt our \\nFederal Government helped create by sending troops to help mine \\nmetals during the world wars.\\n    I ask you to ensure the National EPA Ombudsman's Office is \\nreauthorized and that you pass new legislation that seeks to \\nsecure Federal funding for basin cleanup in our region, prevent \\nfurther delays in remediation and restore citizens' faith in \\ngovernment. After all, had the Ombudsman's Office not been \\ncalled in or if C.L.E.A.N. hadn't formed, do you think any of \\nthe concerns or questions raised here today by not only me but \\nthese other two ladies here would have been brought to \\nanybody's attention?\\n    Thank you very much.\\n    [The prepared statement of Bret Bowers follows:]\",\n",
       " 'Prepared statement of bret bowers': \"COMMUNITY LEADERS FOR EPA, ACCOUNTABILITY NOW,\\n\\n    Good morning, my name is Bret Bowers.

In fact, it's the \\nonly county in Idaho with a population decrease, one of only four \\nnationwide.\\n    Shoshone County has had the State's highest unemployment rate and \\nhighest child-poverty rate.

EPA's view gives them an open-ended timeline at \\nfurther expense to our communities, our private property rights and our \\nenvironment.\\n    And so it all boils down to trust. How can we trust the EPA . . . \\nwhen in 1991, Region-10 Administrator Dana Rasmussen wrote to \\nCongressman Larocco with, ``Let me state unequivocally, it is not EPA's \\nintention to expand the boundaries of the site. We recognize that there \\nare many other regulatory tools besides superfund legislation to affect \\nenvironmental improvements.'' Yet, now we're facing major expansion?\\n    How can we trust the Department of Justice when they are the \\ndriving force behind the lawsuit, and tried to prevent the Ombudsman \\nfrom taking part in our recent hearing?\\n    In closing, we shouldn't be forced to spend the next 30-years \\npaying off a debt our Federal Government helped create . . . by sending \\ntroops to help mine metals during the world wars.\\n    I ask you to ensure the national EPA Ombudsman's Office is \\nreauthorized. and, that you pass new legislation that seeks to secure \\nFederal funding for basin clean-up, prevent further delays in \\nremediation and restore citizen's faith in government.\\n    After all, had the Ombudsman not been called in, or if CLEAN hadn't \\nformed . . . do you think any of the concerns and questions raised \\ntoday would have been brought to your attention?\\n\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you, Mr. Bowers.\\n    I am going to recognize myself.\\n    I know that Ms. Mosley, for instance, has been a very \\nactive environmentalist in our area for a long, long time, very \\nmuch concerned about the environment, very consumer oriented. I \\nwould wager to say that Ms. Boggiatto and Mr. Bowers have been \\nin the same category. So the thing that has really amazed me \\nabout all of this is the fact that it is the people who are so \\nvery pro-environment who appear to have lost confidence in the \\ncredibility of the Environmental Protection Agency.\\n    Now, any comments regarding that, Ms. Boggiatto?\\n    Ms. Boggiatto. Yes, thank you.\\n    Actually, when I first moved----\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Short comments, I only have 5 minutes.\\n    Ms. Boggiatto. Sure. I have lost some confidence. I used to \\nhave a lot of faith in the Environmental Protection Agency to \\nalways use the best available science and data, and after the \\ninvolvement with the Shattuck site I realized that that is not \\nalways the case, which is unfortunate.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Yes, it is really unfortunate, isn't it? You \\nstart to lose faith in your government, so to speak.\\n    Ms. Mosley.\\n    Ms. Mosley. Congressman Bilirakis, before Mr. Martin's \\noffice was contacted, we tried to contact, many of us in the \\ncommunity, the Region 4 Ombudsman's Office; and, to my \\nknowledge, none of our calls were returned. At least I can \\nspeak for myself, none were returned.\\n    Thank you, sir.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. And that is significant because there are \\nregional Ombudsmen, so to speak. Mr. Fields referred to them, \\nwith the idea of basically trying to convince us that it is \\nreally not just one Ombudsman but a number of them spread \\naround the country. And what you are saying is that, for the \\nlongest time, they still didn't return your calls. I know your \\npersistence and your perseverance, and I think that also speaks \\nfor many of the people in the group down there who have shown \\ntheir concern in this regard.\\n    Ms. Mosley. That is right.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. EPA is in the room, and I hope they are \\npicking all that up.\\n    Mr. Bowers.\\n    Mr. Bowers. Mr. Bilirakis, what I also would like to say is \\nsimply that, to give you an idea, just during the RIFS \\nlitigation, litigation for a lawsuit that is going to go to \\ntrial in January, and during the RIFS that we have been \\ninvolved with over the Coeur d'Alene Basin, just in the last \\n2 \\\\1/2\\\\ years EPA has spent roughly a million dollars a month on \\nlitigation and studies instead of cleanup. That should really \\nsummarize, hopefully, to you and to all the folks here on \\nCapitol Hill that if they are so concerned about the \\nenvironment then why are they spending more money fighting \\nthrough litigation rather than helping the communities that \\nknow that some cleanup still may need to be done regardless of \\nhow it got there or who is responsible?\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. I know Ms. Chenoweth-Hage will go into this, \\nbut when did the EPA's involvement in Coeur d'Alene start?\\n    Mr. Bowers. Well, the EPA started in 1983 with the Bunker \\nHill Superfund site. It was declared as the box on the NPL, as \\nmy testimony indicated, and now they want to start completely \\nover and start from square one. And our communities, especially \\nthe communities surrounding the Bunker Hill site in particular, \\nhave had it; and they are literally at breaking point in terms \\nof emotional stress over this issue and what lies ahead in \\nterms of the next potentially 30 years.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Are there EPA personnel located in the area \\nthat have been there for some time?\\n    Mr. Bowers. Yes, there are.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. I have always been wanting to get that clear \\nin my mind. Go ahead. Why don't you explain that?\\n    Mr. Bowers. I am not sure exactly how long the personnel \\nthat have been there have been there. I know that, to give you \\nan idea of the questionable judgment on their call by the EPA \\nstaff in our region serving at the Bunker Hill site, they have \\ngone to great lengths not only in national publications to \\ndisparage our community with some of their negative comments, \\nbut they are actually handing out propaganda from extreme \\nenvironmental groups critical of the natural resource \\nindustries. The EPA has been handing out that documentation.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. The EPA has been handing that out?\\n    Mr. Bowers. That is correct.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. And you know that for a fact?\\n    Mr. Bowers. Handed it right to me on a tour.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. EPA personnel?\\n    Mr. Bowers. That is right.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. And are they located there?\\n    For instance, in our site down in Tarpon Springs, Florida, \\nwe don't have any EPA people that are actually located right in \\nthe site area. Do you have EPA people that are located right in \\nthe area and working on this effort?\\n    Mr. Bowers. I am not sure of how many of the ones that \\nroutinely work on our site at Bunker Hill live in the area.\\n    I know that one, the gentleman I am referring to is Earl \\nLiverman, he lives in Coeur d'Alene and commutes back and \\nforth, which is about 40 miles upstream. But we can get folks \\nflying over from Seattle Region 10 headquarters on a regular \\nbasis at the drop of a dime for the environmental groups to \\ncome over and help explain such things as the RIFS or whatever \\nthey want to come over and talk about. They will drop a dime \\nand fly right over, but yet they are not necessarily responsive \\nto our needs about the concerns we have for our environment.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. The expenditures have been approximately a \\nmillion dollars a month and this goes back to the early 1980's?\\n    Mr. Bowers. No, no, sir. The million dollar a month figure \\nthat I gave you is just during the course of the RFIs which \\nbegan late 1997.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. I see.\\n    Well, my time is up. Gentlelady from Colorado.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Ms. Boggiatto, you were in the room when you heard Mr. \\nFields testify that the recent disclosures by the Department of \\nEnergy about sites that were involved in processing radioactive \\nand toxic materials should not change the timetable for \\ncleanup. Do you think that that will give some reassurance to \\nthe neighbors who are concerned that this will be further \\ndelayed?\\n    Ms. Boggiatto. The fact that Mr. Fields said it wouldn't \\nbe?\\n    Ms. DeGette. Right.\\n    Ms. Boggiatto. No.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Why not?\\n    Ms. Boggiatto. I am sure Mr. Fields has the best \\nintentions, as he has been quite good in our community, coming \\nout to talk with us and such. But the fact that EPA doesn't \\nintend for something to delay their actions doesn't necessarily \\ncorrelate to actual delays, in my experience; and I hope that \\nit does not. But the citizens do want a full characterization \\nof what is actually at that site; and, as I understand it, for \\nthe trainloads or the truckloads to move off the site they will \\nhave to know what exactly is in it so they will know what kind \\nof facility is licensed. So I hope that can be done as quickly \\nas possible. These sort of fears from the Ombudsman's Office \\nabout what kinds of things could be there have been coming up \\nnow for at least a year, and I would certainly like to see an \\naggressive investigation so that it wouldn't----\\n    Ms. DeGette. Why it is important for the neighbors to have \\na cleanup schedule that has some certainty and also some \\nefficiency, if you will?\\n    Ms. Boggiatto. Well, we would like to see the waste dump \\ngone. I mean, after all, no one needs to see that every day in \\nyour neighborhood; and it would be very nice to have that over \\nwith. There is still a lot of effort on the community's part, \\nworking with EPA and businesses around the area, on how all \\nthis will happen and how the waste is being characterized, if \\nit is the same as the other sites. There are still some \\ncontroversies that are sort of ensuing that take a lot of \\npeople's emotional energy as well as physical time, and we \\nwould all like I think for a nice, clean site and to see a \\ndeveloped site in this area.\\n    Ms. DeGette. People have been concerned about what is on \\nthe site and whether it is leaking, whether the \\ncharacterization was correct, for 8 or 9 years now, right?\\n    Ms. Boggiatto. Oh, absolutely. In fact, they were told back \\nin the early 1990's that the waste would be removed and that it \\nwas dangerous and that was what was necessary. They have been \\nconcerned for at lest a decade, and we would like to see this \\ngone, both for the potential health effect as well as the \\nenvironmental effects that that site would have as well.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Bowers, just to clarify, it looks to me, in reviewing \\nyour testimony and also your vitae, that C.L.E.A.N. is \\nbasically a group that is put together by businesses and the \\nChamber of Commerce to make sure that their interests are being \\nrepresented. Would that be a fair assessment?\\n    Mr. Bowers. Not only businesses and the Chamber of \\nCommerce, ma'am, but certainly it includes our elected \\nofficials at the city and county and State representative \\nlevel.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Okay. But now you are actually on the payroll \\nof the Chamber of Commerce and then C.L.E.A.N. is pretty much \\nan arm of the Chamber of Commerce, would that be correct?\\n    Mr. Bowers. That is correct.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have any \\nfurther questions and yield back the balance of my time.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. The gentleman from Illinois.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; and I appreciate \\nthose testifying here today.\\n    Ms. Mosley, you were here when Mr. Fields was testifying \\nand obviously you followed a lot of the questions and the \\nOmbudsman reports to his deputy. Do you believe people in the \\nlocal community understand that the Ombudsman is just another \\nEPA employee?\\n    Ms. Mosley. Oh, I think they, the average person, thinks \\nthat he is an EPA employee, but he certainly is not average.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. And following the discussions we had and using \\nthe terminology of the law, the Ombudsman was supposed to have \\naccess to the highest officials in the EPA. Do you think that \\nis--based upon your observation of the testimony earlier today, \\ndo you think that occurs?\\n    Ms. Mosley. Absolutely not.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Ms. Boggiatto, do you think that actually \\noccurs, same question, based upon--I know you are a little \\nbit--you are a little bit different because you had, if I am \\ncorrect, a lot of frustration over many, many years, like many \\nof us do, but you have actually seen some positive aspects and \\nthen now might be a change back as we look at--so the same \\nquestion, do you think that the Ombudsman--the application of \\nthe statute and the authorization says he has access to the \\nofficials in the EPA. Do you think that is true?\\n    Ms. Boggiatto. I think he has access to Mr. Fields, and he \\nis one of the highest officials. Access is one thing. Actually \\nbeing sort of listened to and respect and supported well is \\nanother.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Bower, same kind of question.\\n    Mr. Bowers. Sir, could you repeat the question for me?\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Well, the basic tenet of the authorization \\nlegislation says that the Ombudsman should have access to the \\nhighest officials in the EPA. Do you think that that occurs?\\n    Mr. Bowers. Well, he might have access to the highest \\nofficials within the EPA, but I am afraid that, despite the \\nefforts of that we have already seen in our communities with \\nthe Ombudsman and certainly with the tape that I have brought \\nhere today--and I hope I get a chance to show that or at least \\nenter it into the record--I can certainly say for a fact that I \\nam not so sure EPA Region 10, let alone headquarters right here \\nin our Nation's capital, really does care about any of the \\nfindings that the Ombudsman's Office has.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. And let me just follow up, again, you observed \\nthe discourse we had on small business liability relief and the \\ntrouble we have getting language from the EPA. Ms. Boggiatto, \\nit reminded me of a comment you made that here we had promises \\nin the 1990's that the waste would be removed; and then based \\nupon those promises--those promises not being fulfilled or at \\nleast uncertainty is pervasive. Those are kind of reaffirmation \\nof the kind of frustrations we have with EPA and frustration \\nand inability to get some clear guidance and affirmation of \\nwhat is going to occur in the future and how we can move.\\n    Tell me how that affects--and I think my colleague Diana \\nDeGette mentioned this--how does this affect the community when \\nthere is uncertainty and, really, your association and \\norganization----\\n    Ms. Boggiatto. Well, as we all know, when you live next to \\na toxic or radioactive waste dump, you live--and I don't live \\nright next to this site, but many of the citizens I work with \\ndo live within sight of it--that is emotionally stressful, to \\nsay the least, because you are in fear for your health and your \\nchildren's health and the rest of your family's health; and I \\nthink that toll is a huge burden.\\n    It also--the fact that in 1992 or so the citizens were told \\nby EPA that the preferred alternative was removal and that they \\nthen changed, reversed course without going back to public \\ncomment on that and then said, ``Tough luck, watch us bury it'' \\nthere is--it is hard to--it is sort of hard to regain the faith \\nin the administrative agency after that.\\n    In fact, when I first moved to Denver, I did not get \\ninvolved in this site because I was convinced the citizens had \\nit wrong, that EPA could not have done what they were alleging, \\nand waited a couple of years until 1998 to finally get \\ninvolved, when I realized, you know, that I think there is \\nsomething here.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. Exactly the same experience I felt with the \\nissue. The EPA comes in and says, ``Tough luck, you settle or \\nyou get sued.'' That is just a bad way of doing business.\\n    I would end with this, Mr. Chairman, and ask for our \\npanelists here also to--if they could, in their reviewing of \\nthe process, what recommendations would you provide for us if \\nwe look at reauthorizing the Ombudsman--what more tools does he \\nneed? I mean, you are on the front lines. You are trying to \\ndeal with issues. How do we empower him to get the word to the \\nhighest officials in the Agency and not only get heard but have \\na receptive ear?\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Might I recommend a very, significant \\nquestion? Might I recommend that they ought to give some \\nthought to it based on their experiences, and hopefully they \\ncan furnish that to us in writing, John.\\n    Mr. Shimkus. That is what I would request, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. That is, I think, a very good idea. Would \\nyou be willing to do that? There will be additional questions \\nthat will be furnished to you. I don't know how we are on \\nreauthorization because of what is happening up here, with only \\na few days to go and that sort of thing, but it may be on a \\nfast track. Hopefully, it is. So the sooner you provide us your \\nsuggestions, and recommendations in response to Mr. Shimkus' \\nquestion on the Ombudsman areas you feel ought to be changed or \\nimproved, the better.\\n    I didn't mean to cut you off.\\n    [The following was received for the record:]\\n\\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.062\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.063\\n    \\n    Mr. Shimkus. I have finished with my questions. I \\nappreciate you taking the time to visit with us.\\n    I yield back my time.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. The gentlelady from Idaho, Mrs. Chenoweth-\\nHage.\\n    Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Chairman, before I begin my questioning, I have a \\nmatter here. It is entitled, The Investigative Report \\nConcerning Abuse of Federal Law and the Citizens of North Idaho \\nby the EPA. It is an investigative congressional investigative \\nreport that I put together. It is in its draft final stage; and \\nI would, without objection, like to enter the final report into \\nthe record.\\n    It points out 18 different areas that this Ombudsman, who \\nhas an average of $35,000 a case, he is looking into 18 \\ndifferent issues. He looks into everything I want to him to, \\njust in this one site. It is so massive.\\n    Mr. Chairman, I remember a long time ago a judge said to me \\nduring a hearing, you never want to open a door in a line of \\nquestioning that you are not prepared to walk through as well \\nas everybody else, let everybody else in. Well, that happened \\nup in the hearing. That was a 14-hour hearing conducted by our \\nOmbudsman, and that has been captured on film. I have referred \\nto it, as has Mr. Bowers; and I wonder if, without objection, \\nif we might be able to show that 3\\\\1/2\\\\ minute film of the \\nquestioning by the Ombudsman of an EPA attorney.\\n    So I would yield back the balance of my time if, without \\nobjection, we can do that, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. How long will that take?\\n    Mr. Bowers. Three and a half minutes.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Three and a half minutes. Let us do it, if \\nthere is no objection.\\n    Ms. DeGette. Mr. Chairman, if I can just--reserving my \\nright to object. I am not going to object. Let me just say that \\nwe didn't learn about the videotape until this morning. It \\nwasn't submitted as part of the prepared testimony of Mr. \\nBowers. But, having said that, I am always a proponent of \\nsunshine.\\n    Let me just add that the issue of the boundaries of the \\nBunker Hill site is moot, because the Court of Appeals \\noverturned the challenge and no one challenged it in the \\nDistrict of Columbia. So the issues in the Asarco case, which \\nis scheduled to start on January 22 of next year, are the \\nliability and natural resources damage issues, and that is \\ngoing to be happening in the District Court of Idaho.\\n    So I would ask that a summary of the scope of the facility \\nand the actual transcript sections where this issue was \\ndiscussed at the Ombudsman hearing on August 19 of this year be \\ninserted into the record to supplement the videotape so that we \\ncan have the full discussion rather than an edited portion. I \\nthink it is irregular to have edited portions of field hearings \\nshown in hearings, but I won't object to it so long as the \\nrecord----\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Without objection, that will be the case. \\nThank you very much for your consideration.\\n    [The information referred to follows:]\\n\\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.064\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.065\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.066\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.067\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.068\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.069\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.070\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.071\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.072\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.073\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.074\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.075\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.076\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.077\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.078\\n    \\n    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.079\\n    \\n    [Video played.]\\n    Mr. Bowers. That is the end of the video.\\n    Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage. Mr. Chairman, I see my time is up.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. I thank the gentlelady.\\n    Well, I think our time is up, and we will excuse the panel.\\n    I will just say Ms. DeGette is the only one of the members \\nof the subcommittee left, but if she could have experienced--\\nand she probably has, maybe even more so at Shattuck--what we \\nhave been going through down there regarding the premature \\ndecision-making without full and adequate research, I think we \\nwould all be pretty shocked and aghast at the overall picture.\\n    Ms. DeGette. If the gentleman would yield, that was the \\npart of the problem that we saw in Shattuck, was apparently in \\nthe late 1980's, early 1990's, under the Reagan/Bush, or at \\nleast the Bush administration, EPA, the initial record of \\ndecision was apparently made in back rooms between the Region 8 \\nEPA administrator, Shattuck and heavens knows who else.\\n    So, you know, one of the great things that we have really \\ncherished in Denver is the community activists who just \\nwouldn't take no for an answer ever and also the active \\ninvolvement of the Ombudsman who really helped all of us who \\nwere working on it. So thank you for your leadership on this, \\nand good luck to all your folks in Florida.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. And good luck to all your folks in Denver, \\nand hopefully we can work together when it comes to \\nreauthorization.\\n    Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage. Mr. Chairman, before you bring the \\ngavel down, I would just have one point that I would like to \\nclarify that was brought up. That is the Asarco suit. That case \\nwas almost remanded--almost all of it was remanded back. So \\nthere are many, many other issues involved in the Superfund \\nsite in northern Idaho, and it will be in ongoing litigation. \\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n    Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Bowers and ladies, Ms. Boggiatto and Ms. Mosley, thank \\nyou so very much for taking time away from your families--Ms. \\nMosley brought her family with her--and your jobs to come here. \\nSome of you have traveled quite a distance, and we appreciate \\nit very much.\\n    Again, get that information to us and anything else that \\nyou feel you haven't already communicated here today which you \\nfeel might be significant in what we are going to do.\\n    This hearing is adjourned.\\n    [Whereupon, at 12:50 p.m., the subcommittees were \\nadjourned.]\\n    [Additional material submitted for the record follows:]\\n    [EPA did not respond to questions 2, 3, 6, and 9 of letter \\nsent by Chairman Bilirakis and Chairman Oxley.]\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.080\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.081\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.082\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.083\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.084\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.085\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.086\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.087\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.088\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.089\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.090\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.091\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.092\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.093\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.094\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.095\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.096\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.097\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.098\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.099\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.100\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.101\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.102\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.103\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.104\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.105\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.106\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.107\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.108\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.109\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.110\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.111\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.112\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.113\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.114\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.115\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.116\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.117\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.118\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.119\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.120\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.121\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.122\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.123\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.124\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.125\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.126\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.127\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.128\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.129\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.130\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.131\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.132\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.133\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.134\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.135\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.136\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.137\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.138\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.139\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.140\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.141\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.142\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.143\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.144\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.145\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.146\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.147\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.148\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.149\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.150\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.151\\n\\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7120.152\\n\\n\\x1a\\n</pre></body></html>\"}"
